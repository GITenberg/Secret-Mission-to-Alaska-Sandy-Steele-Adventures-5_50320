<br />Off to Alaska</h2>
<p>Sandy Steele twisted his lanky six-foot frame in
the cramped airplane seat, stretching his long legs
out in the aisle. Yawning, he glanced out of the
small, round window beside him. Although it was
daylight now, the ground was completely hidden
by a layer of dense clouds that stretched away to
the horizon on all sides like fluffy marshmallow
topping. The sound of the motors was a dull, monotonous
throbbing in his ears.</p>
<p>Sandy leaned forward and ruffled the black
crew cut that was just visible over the top of the
seat ahead of him. &ldquo;Hey, Jerry, you awake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; a voice mumbled sleepily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awake.
Are we going to land yet?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Sandy looked across the aisle
at his father, who was just lighting his pipe. &ldquo;How
about it, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. John Steele studied his watch thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d say about another half hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward, an army corporal, walked back
from the forward compartment with a tray of
paper cups. &ldquo;Coffee, anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steaming-hot black liquid cleared the cobwebs
out of Sandy&rsquo;s head, and he began to look
forward with excited anticipation to their arrival
in Canada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Professor Crowell meet us at the airport?&rdquo;
he asked his father.</p>
<p>Dr. Steele nodded. &ldquo;Yes. Then we&rsquo;ll drive back
to his place and pick up his dog team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry James&rsquo;s granite-jawed face appeared over
the back of the seat as he knelt, facing Sandy.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Berkley Crowell breeds sled dogs as a hobby,&rdquo;
Dr. Steele explained. &ldquo;Eskimo huskies. He&rsquo;s taking
his prize team up to Alaska to compete in the annual
race from Whitehorse to Skagway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, that sounds like fun,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; the doctor went on, &ldquo;that
will be one of your major jobs on this expedition.
You boys will drive the truck with the dogs and
help the professor with their care and feeding.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Dr. Steele turned his attention back to his book
as Sandy and Jerry got into a conversation with
the young corporal who had served the coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both you fellows from California?&rdquo; the corporal
asked. &ldquo;Whereabouts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valley View,&rdquo; Sandy told him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s near
San Diego, but more inland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a cousin in the Navy,&rdquo; the corporal said.
&ldquo;He was stationed at San Diego. Nice country.&rdquo;
He grinned. &ldquo;You guys are going to find the climate
of Alaska a lot different than California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry shivered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to school in Valley View?&rdquo; the corporal
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High school,&rdquo; Sandy told him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both
juniors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long are you going to be in Alaska?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About three weeks, I guess. It&rsquo;s the Christmas
vacation, and my dad got our principal to let us
take an extra week on account of the educational
value of this expedition we&rsquo;re going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal looked interested. &ldquo;What kind of
an expedition is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dad is a United States government geologist,&rdquo;
Sandy explained. &ldquo;This expedition is part
of a long-range Canadian-American project to
chart glacial movements during the Ice Age. We&rsquo;ll
be collecting soil, rock and ore samples on our
way through western Canada and Alaska.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like fun,&rdquo; the corporal said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
get a kick out of Alaska. It&rsquo;s a great place. I&rsquo;ve
flown up there a couple of times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s our forty-ninth state like, anyway?&rdquo;
Jerry asked curiously. &ldquo;We bought it from the Indians
for twenty-four dollars, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and the corporal laughed. &ldquo;That was
Manhattan Island, you dope!&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;We
bought Alaska from the Russians for about
$7,000,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s twice as big as Texas,&rdquo; the corporal told
them, &ldquo;but the population is only a little over
200,000. And most of these people have only been
there since the end of World War Two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we never would have realized just how
valuable Alaska is if the Japanese hadn&rsquo;t tried to
attack us across the Aleutian Islands,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>At that moment, a buzzer sounded and the
green light at the front of the cabin began to
flash. &ldquo;Oh-oh,&rdquo; the corporal said. &ldquo;Looks like
we&rsquo;re getting ready to land. Fasten your seat belts,
folks.&rdquo; He turned and hurried forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Dr. Steele stood up and removed his mackinaw
from the overhead rack. As he did so, a big, black,
ominous-looking .45 Colt automatic slipped out of
one of the pockets and crashed to the floor.</p>
<p>The boys&rsquo; eyes widened and Sandy blurted out
in shocked surprise, &ldquo;Where did you get that,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele retrieved the gun hastily and stuck
it back into his pocket. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;something a
friend advised me to bring with me. In case we
get a chance to do any hunting,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Sandy frowned. &ldquo;Hunting with an <i>automatic</i>!
That&rsquo;s crazy, Dad. Wouldn&rsquo;t a rifle have been
more practical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thin smile spread the doctor&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;re right. I should have consulted you before
I got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just where <i>did</i> you get it, Dad?&rdquo; Sandy asked
suspiciously. &ldquo;The Colt .45 automatic is an official
U.S. Army sidearm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was just the faintest trace of irritation in
Dr. Steele&rsquo;s voice when he answered. &ldquo;All these
questions! You&rsquo;re beginning to sound like your
Aunt Vivian.... Look, we had better fasten our
safety belts. We&rsquo;re going to land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Dad, sure,&rdquo; Sandy said. There was something
uncommonly mysterious about his father&rsquo;s
behavior, and it worried him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER TWO</span>
<br />A Hint of Trouble</h2>
<p>The big U.S. army transport touched down at
the R.C.A.F. military airstrip at Fort St. John,
British Columbia, shortly after dawn on December
23. Dr. Steele and his party were groggy after
spending a restless night of fitful slumber on the
hard, uncomfortable canvas seats that were slung
along the walls of the plane&rsquo;s huge, drafty cabin.
But the first bite of the dry-ice bitter air of the
Canadian winter snapped them wide-awake and
alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed, bundled up like a
bear in his hooded parka. &ldquo;It must be at least one
thousand degrees below zero.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Dr. Steele smiled. &ldquo;You think this is cold? Just
wait until we get farther up north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lou Mayer, Dr. Steele&rsquo;s assistant, groaned.
&ldquo;When does the next plane leave for California?&rdquo;
He broke into a fit of uncontrollable shudders. A
dark, mild-mannered young man in his late
twenties, Lou had been born in Texas and spent
half of his life in Southern California. He consequently
had little tolerance for the cold.</p>
<p>Sandy grinned superciliously. &ldquo;You guys should
have been smart like me. I wore my long red
flannels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good point,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said. &ldquo;In this
country, proper clothing is essential to survival.
It&rsquo;s as vital as sufficient food and drink. You must
start conditioning yourselves to think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abruptly, they all became aware that Jerry was
staring with hypnotic fixity toward the edge of the
landing field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Sandy asked. &ldquo;What gives with you?
What are you looking at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s eyes were glazed. Dumbly he raised one
arm and pointed at the mountains of snow banked
at the sides of the field. Finally he managed to
mumble, &ldquo;Snow. That&rsquo;s snow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is. You act as if you never saw it
before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Jerry nodded, wide-eyed. &ldquo;I never did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and the two men broke out laughing.
&ldquo;Well, this is an occasion,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said. &ldquo;I
promise you you will have your fill of it before
we&rsquo;re through with this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was flabbergasted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of it,
but I just never realized there could be so much
of it in one place. Man! That one drift must be
twenty feet high. Can you imagine waking up
some morning in Valley View and finding that in
your front yard, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t seen too much of it,&rdquo; Sandy
admitted. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been up to the Northwest
with Dad a few times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment a jeep screeched to a stop
nearby, its exhaust spewing out smoke like a
chimney. The corporal at the wheel leaned out
and yelled to them. &ldquo;Dr. Steele here?&rdquo; After the
geologist identified himself, the corporal told them
to pile into the jeep. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gent waiting for
you at headquarters. A detail will be right out to
unload your baggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you keep these runways free of ice?&rdquo;
Dr. Steele shouted to the driver above the loud,
rowdy roar of the little jeep motor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sweep &rsquo;em with giant vacuum cleaners regularly,&rdquo;
the corporal replied. &ldquo;When it gets really
rough we melt the ice with flame throwers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Professor Berkley Crowell was waiting for them
close by the glowing steel-drum coal stove that
reinforced the electric heaters in the big quonset-hut
headquarters. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t beat the old-fashioned
way,&rdquo; he said with a smile, toasting his fingers
in the shimmering heat waves that radiated
from the top of the steel drum.</p>
<p>The professor was a slight, stooped, very British-looking
man in his middle fifties. He had a thin
weatherbeaten face, a sharp nose and a close-cropped
mustache. His deep-set blue eyes were
warm and full of good humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, upon being introduced to
Sandy and Jerry, &ldquo;I understand that you boys will
be helping me with my dog team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the best we can, sir,&rdquo; Sandy told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t give you too much trouble,&rdquo; the
professor said. &ldquo;Titan&mdash;that&rsquo;s my lead dog&mdash;he
practically runs the whole show himself. Possesses
human intelligence, that animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we get to see them?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as we get back to my ranch. I&rsquo;m situated
about ten miles down the Alaska Highway,
toward Dawson Creek. That&rsquo;s the southern terminus
of the highway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had finished the steaming mugs of
hot coffee served up by the flying officers&rsquo; mess,
Professor Crowell and his party climbed aboard
the big station wagon parked in the drive and
drove away from the air base.</p>
<p>The Alaska Highway was a broad, smooth,
gravel-topped road hewed through some of the
thickest forests and most rugged terrain on the
North American continent. Now the gravel was
topped by a thick crust of snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miracle of our century,&rdquo; Professor Crowell
explained as they drove. &ldquo;Built in just eight
months by your amazing U.S. Army engineers in
1943, when the Japanese forces were threatening
the Aleutian Island chain. It was a lifesaving
artery to Alaska and a vital chain to our western
air bases. Sixteen hundred and seventy-one miles.
Just imagine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An auto filled with shouting children whizzed
past them, traveling in the opposite direction. It
was weighted down with valises and bundles
strapped to the roof and fenders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they going?&rdquo; Jerry inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pioneer settlers for your glorious forty-ninth
state,&rdquo; Professor Crowell answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
steady stream of them. Did you know that the
population of Alaska has tripled since World War
Two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sort of gives you goose pimples,&rdquo; Sandy said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost as if you turned back the clock a
hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last frontier of the United States,&rdquo; Dr.
Steele remarked. &ldquo;On this planet, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will we be leaving, Professor Crowell?&rdquo;
Lou Mayer asked.</p>
<p>The professor glanced down at his wrist watch.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s eight o&rsquo;clock now. I estimate we&rsquo;ll be on
our way shortly after noon. I want you fellows to
get a hot meal into you first. Then we&rsquo;ll load the
truck and station wagon.&rdquo; He looked around at
Dr. Steele. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pick up your equipment at
Fort St. John on the way back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was fascinated by the high banks of snow
on the shoulders of the road. &ldquo;Boy, I wonder how
they keep this thing open. Back in the States we&rsquo;re
always reading about whole towns being cut off
by a measly two feet of snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even big cities like New York,&rdquo; Sandy chimed
in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The professor smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because cities like
New York aren&rsquo;t prepared for heavy snowfalls. Up
here, we expect it. Why, I bet a little village like
Dawson Creek has more snow equipment than
most big cities on the eastern seaboard of the
United States. Along the Alaska Highway, for instance,
there are one hundred and twenty-five
weather stations alone, and almost as many maintenance
stations. No, you stand a better chance of
getting marooned on the Pennsylvania Turnpike
than you do on this road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Crowell&rsquo;s ranch house was located on
a cutoff about a quarter of a mile from the main
highway. It was a sprawling frame building with
a large barn at the back of the property and completely
surrounded by a thick spruce forest.</p>
<p>The professor, a widower, had twin daughters,
Judy and Jill, who kept house for him. Their
domestic efficiency made them seem older than
their seventeen years. The girls were blond and
blue-eyed and very pretty, and Jerry couldn&rsquo;t look
at them without stammering and blushing. It was
obvious he was smitten with the twins.</p>
<p>The Crowell household also included a middle-aged
French couple, the Dupr&eacute;s; Henri took care
of the livestock and his wife, Marie, did the cooking.
Then there was Tagish Charley, who took
care of the kennels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Tagish Charley was a full-blooded Indian. He
stood 6&prime; 4&Prime; tall, weighed 230 pounds and was as
lithe as a panther. His hair was the flat black
color of charcoal, and his skin was the texture
of ancient parchment. Charley could have been
any age, from 40 to 400. He spoke English well
enough, when he spoke, which was very seldom;
and he said what he had to say in as few words as
possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charley is economical with his money and his
speech,&rdquo; Professor Crowell said when he introduced
him to his guests. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as stoic as a cigar-store
Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Jerry hit it off with Charley from the
start. While the geologists went over the last-minute
details of their trip in the professor&rsquo;s study,
Charley took the boys out to the kennel at one
side of the barn. A dozen husky dogs were frolicking
in the snow inside a wire enclosure. As soon as
they saw Charley they all rushed over to the gate
and piled up in a seething mass of yelping, snarling,
twisting fur, leaping up against the chain link
fence and falling back on top of each other. It was
a wild melee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed. &ldquo;They look as if
they&rsquo;d eat you alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian grunted. &ldquo;No hurt. They want to
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry looked dubious. &ldquo;I bet they play rough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The Eskimo dogs were handsome animals. In
reality they weren&rsquo;t particularly large; probably
they weighed about 75 to 80 pounds and stood 18
inches high at the shoulder; but with their broad
chests, thick necks and massive heads they looked
enormous. Their great thick coats varied in color
from black-and-white to slate-gray, solidly and in
combinations of all three. They had powerful
wolflike muzzles, sharp ears and slanting eyes.</p>
<p>Tagish Charley opened the gate and motioned
the boys to follow him into the pen. The dogs
barked and leaped around the Indian, nipping
his trousers and mittens playfully. They ignored
the boys. There was one exception. Standing off
to one side was a big, solid-black husky with a
white mask across his eyes and upper muzzle. By
far the largest dog of the lot&mdash;Sandy estimated his
weight to be at least 100 pounds&mdash;he seemed to
regard the antics of his fellows with regal aloofness.
Finally his eyes turned solemnly on the boys
and he started toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charley!&rdquo; Jerry yelled, grabbing Sandy&rsquo;s arm
nervously. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s charging us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy laughed. &ldquo;Go on, you sissy. His tail is
wagging. That means he wants to be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that, and I know that,&rdquo; said Jerry,
edging backward, &ldquo;but does <i>he</i> know that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;That Black Titan,&rdquo; Charley said. &ldquo;Lead dog.
Best husky in all the North.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the big dog nuzzled against his leg, Sandy
leaned down and stroked his broad, glossy head.
&ldquo;Nice feller. Good boy.... Hey, where did you
get that lump on your skull, Titan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He save professor&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; Charley declared
without emotion. &ldquo;Bad man hit him on head
with club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad man! When?&rdquo; the boys exclaimed in a
chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five, six nights back. Titan hear prowler.
Jump over fence. Man open window, climb into
professor&rsquo;s room, choke professor. Titan jump
through window, save him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to the burglar? Did they catch
him?&rdquo; Sandy asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He club Titan, dive through window into
snow. Get away with dog team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;Even up here they got characters
like that. Only instead of a getaway car,
they use dog sleds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he get away with anything valuable?&rdquo;
Sandy asked.</p>
<p>The Indian&rsquo;s brown face seemed to grow even
darker. &ldquo;He no come to rob money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Charley shrugged. &ldquo;Many strange things happen
here this year. Professor sleep with gun under his
pillow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Jerry exchanged wondering looks.
&ldquo;Now who&rsquo;d be out to get a nice old geezer like
the professor?&rdquo; Jerry wanted to know.</p>
<p>Sandy was thoughtful. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Jerry. I
don&rsquo;t know. But I have a feeling we&rsquo;re going to
find a lot more excitement on this trip than we
bargained for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; a terse female voice said
from behind them.</p>
<p>Surprised, Sandy whirled around to find Judy
Crowell standing in the open gateway. Bundled
up in ski pants, mackinaw and high boots, she
might have been a boy, except for the mass of
golden hair sticking out in tufts from beneath her
wool cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charley&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A lot of strange
things have been happening around here during
the last few months. Ever since Dad spent a week
in Ottawa this fall, he&rsquo;s been a different man.
He&rsquo;s lost weight. He can&rsquo;t sleep or eat. And&mdash;&rdquo;
she shivered&mdash;&ldquo;he always carries a pistol with him.
He&rsquo;s afraid of something&mdash;or someone. But when
Jill and I ask him, he just laughs and says we&rsquo;ve
been seeing too many American motion pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Sandy felt cold prickles creep up his back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
funny. My dad brought along a gun with him
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry whistled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all mean, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, pal. But I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still surrounded by his ring of canine admirers,
Tagish Charley addressed Judy Crowell. &ldquo;You no
worry about your papa, Miss Judy. Charley take
good care of him. Bad fellers come around, me
break &rsquo;em up like firewood.&rdquo; He made a twisting
motion in the air with his two huge fists.</p>
<p>For some reason Sandy felt relieved. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know you were coming with us, Charley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley&rsquo;s serious, expressionless face altered
for a fleeting instant in a suggestion of a smile. &ldquo;I
just decide now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER THREE</span>
<br />A Mysterious Intruder</h2>
<p>The little caravan headed north on the Alaska
Highway about 12:20 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> Professor Crowell, Dr.
Steele and Lou Mayer led the way in the big station
wagon, which was loaded down with scientific
equipment and supplies. Sandy, Jerry and Tagish
Charley followed in a surplus U.S. Army six-by-six
truck. The boys and the Indian all rode in the
roomy cab, with Sandy at the wheel. The back of
the truck, roofed with a heavy canvas top, had
been converted into a comfortable compartment
for the professor&rsquo;s seven prize huskies. Here, also,
were the big dog sled, a pyramidal tent, sleeping
bags, cooking utensils and a Coleman stove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>As Professor Crowell pointed out, there were
tourist camps and aid stations all along the highway,
but sometimes it was more convenient to set
up one&rsquo;s own camp at the side of the road. Particularly
in winter, travelers had to be prepared for
emergencies.</p>
<p>Both vehicles were equipped with heavy-duty
tire chains on all wheels, plus oversized snow tires,
and they rode smoothly and firmly across the hard-packed
snow surface of the highway.</p>
<p>As the afternoon deepened into an early dusk,
the temperature plummeted, and the chill penetrated
the cab of the truck, even though the heater
was going full blast. Sandy doubled up his hands
into fists inside his mittens and wriggled his feet
inside his fur-lined boots to stimulate his circulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m warm as toast except for my fingers and
toes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jerry fingered his nose gingerly. &ldquo;My old schnozzola
is getting numb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tagish Charley, who was taking his turn at the
wheel, patted his stomach. &ldquo;Belly say soon time to
stop and eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry yawned and looked at the dashboard clock.
&ldquo;Three-thirty,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been on
the road for about three hours. How far have we
come?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Sandy studied the speedometer. &ldquo;A little over
one hundred and ten miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty good,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re averaging
almost forty per.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little while later they passed a river, and now
Charley turned the headlights on. Out of nowhere,
it seemed, thousands of tiny snowflakes
swirled suddenly into the yellow cones of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s snowing!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed.</p>
<p>Sandy surveyed the wilderness on both sides
anxiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to spend the night out here
in a blizzard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stop soon,&rdquo; Charley assured him.</p>
<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when
they rounded a curve and came upon a little settlement
set back in a clearing in a pine grove. It
consisted of two large quonset huts and three small
log cabins. The warm glow of lights in the small
windows of the buildings gave Sandy a feeling
of well-being. The station wagon slowed down,
tooted twice with its horn and swerved off the
highway into the circular drive that had been
plowed up to the entrance of the main building.
As the truck&rsquo;s headlights swept across the front of
the other larger quonset hut, they could see that
it had big sliding doors that allowed one entire
wall to open up like an airplane hangar. And as
the lights probed the interior of the hut, they
could make out a neat two-engine plane mounted
on skis. The brief glimpse also revealed a big
bulldozer plow and other snow-fighting machinery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Road crew,&rdquo; Charley told the boys. &ldquo;They
good fellers. We eat good, drink good and sleep
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;You were so right, Charley,&rdquo; Jerry said later, as
he pushed himself away from the big plank table
after sharing a hearty meal of roast lamb, fried
potatoes, home-made rolls and apple pie with
Superintendent MacKensie and his maintenance
gang. &ldquo;I never ate so good.&rdquo; He polished off a pint
mug of milk that was half cream and sighed. &ldquo;Or
drank so good either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Superintendent MacKensie, a big florid-faced
man, tugged at one side of his blond handlebar
mustache. &ldquo;Here now, you&rsquo;re not finished, are
you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Jerry patted the round swell of his stomach. &ldquo;If
I ate another mouthful, I&rsquo;d burst, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; MacKensie said solemnly.
&ldquo;Now Cooky&rsquo;s feelings will be hurt and he&rsquo;ll make
you wash the dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>A swarthy giant of a man at the far end of the
table pounded the planks with hamlike fists. &ldquo;By
gar, I weel!&rdquo; he roared in mock anger. &ldquo;You no
like Frenchy&rsquo;s cooking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone laughed as Jerry looked around uncertainly.</p>
<p>Dr. Steele patted his mouth with a napkin. &ldquo;As
Jerry so aptly put it, Frenchy, &lsquo;We never ate so
good.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy you enjoyed it, Doctor,&rdquo; Superintendent
MacKensie said. &ldquo;Now if you&rsquo;d like to go
into the other room and toast your feet by the
hearth, I&rsquo;ll have one of the lads stir up that fire in
your cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent suggestion,&rdquo; Professor Crowell
agreed.</p>
<p>With the exception of a half dozen men of the
road crew who had some tasks to attend to, they
all retired to the large, comfortably furnished
recreation room where an enormous stone fireplace
almost covered one wall. Sandy, Jerry and
Lou Mayer sat cross-legged directly in front of the
blazing logs, on a thick bearskin robe that was
spread-eagled on the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Man!&rdquo; Jerry whispered in an awed voice, lifting
the huge head and inspecting the gleaming
fangs that were still frightening even in death.
&ldquo;I think if I ever ran into one of these babies I&rsquo;d
just roll over and die before he laid a paw on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lou Mayer poked one of the clawed forepaws
with his toe. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a sure bet you&rsquo;d die if he
ever <i>did</i> lay one of those paws on you. They&rsquo;re as
big as dinner plates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Superintendent MacKensie, slouched in an old-fashioned
rocker, sucked his pipe gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen them kill a horse with one swipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve <i>seen</i> them?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>MacKensie smiled reminiscently. &ldquo;As a matter
of fact <i>that</i> fellow did kill my horse. I was hunting
with a party up on Kodiak Island. I blundered
around a rock right into the beggar. He rose up on
his hind legs, caught my horse with one blow in
the choppers and that was it. I managed to jump
free. Then I pumped five shots into him. They
might as well have been darts. He would have got
me for sure if the guide hadn&rsquo;t dropped him with
a brain shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Powerful beasts,&rdquo; Professor Crowell acknowledged.
&ldquo;The Roman Emperor Nero used to pit
bears against lions in the arena. And frequently
they killed the lions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lucky thing we did bring all those guns
along&mdash;&rdquo; Jerry began, than caught himself as
Sandy and Lou Mayer stiffened visibly. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s
a good idea with mankillers like this running
loose,&rdquo; he finished lamely.</p>
<p>Superintendent MacKensie laughed. &ldquo;So you
expect to do some hunting while you&rsquo;re up north,
do you?&rdquo; he said to Professor Crowell. He turned
to Dr. Steele. &ldquo;Of course, the customs officials
plugged up the barrels of your weapons, didn&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they did,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said emphatically.
Speaking directly to Sandy and Jerry, he explained.
&ldquo;You see, the Canadians don&rsquo;t want visitors
to shoot up their game preserves, and quite
rightly so. When we cross the border into Alaska,
the officials will remove the seals from the barrels.
Do you <i>understand</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Sandy mumbled, looking quickly
away into the embers. He was stunned. <i>Those
automatics weren&rsquo;t plugged up.</i> He had never
heard his father deliberately tell a lie before.</p>
<p>Unaware of the tension that had mushroomed
up, MacKensie stretched. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better be getting
back to the radio shack and see what&rsquo;s come in
from the weather stations on this storm. If she
looks bad, I&rsquo;ll have to keep a crew on alert. Any
time you gentlemen feel like sacking in, go to it.
Your cabin should be warm now. It&rsquo;s small, but
cozy. There are six bunk beds, so it won&rsquo;t be too
crowded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Charley?&rdquo; Sandy asked, suddenly
aware that the Indian was not in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right after supper he went outside to get your
dogs bedded down,&rdquo; one of the crewmen told him.</p>
<p>Professor Crowell smiled. &ldquo;He treats them like
children, and they love it. Actually, though, all
those huskies need for a bed is a soft snowdrift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They like to sleep in snow?&rdquo; Jerry asked incredulously.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they freeze?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, once they tuck in their paws and stick their
noses under their tails, they&rsquo;re ready for anything.
Have you noticed their coats? Double thick.
Underneath that heavy outside fur there&rsquo;s a short
woolly undercoat. The fact is they&rsquo;re probably
more comfortable sleeping outside than next to a
roaring fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lou Mayer held his hands up to the flames. &ldquo;We
have nothing in common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After MacKensie left, the other maintenance
men began to drift off to bed. The snow was coming
down very hard, and they faced the prospect
of a long, hard day battling the drifts.</p>
<p>About nine o&rsquo;clock, Sandy yawned and
stretched. &ldquo;What do you say we turn in, pal?&rdquo; he
said to Jerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; Jerry replied promptly.</p>
<p>The boys looked inquiringly at the older men.
&ldquo;You two run along,&rdquo; Dr. Steele told them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
finish our pipes first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Jerry dug their mackinaws and mittens
out of a heap of clothing on the long table in
the vestibule and slipped on their boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a hundred-yard walk,&rdquo; Sandy admitted,
&ldquo;but at thirty below zero it&rsquo;s worth the
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; Jerry agreed, wrapping his wool muffler
around his lantern jaw.</p>
<p>The boys stepped out the back door of the big
hut and followed the path leading back to the
cabins. Ten feet away from the building, the wind-whipped
grains of ice and snow closed in on them
like a white curtain, blotting out their vision. If
it had not been for the clearly defined path, they
would have been helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could get lost in your own back yard in
this stuff,&rdquo; Jerry gasped. &ldquo;Yipes!&rdquo; he shouted as
he blundered off the path into a snowdrift.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the St. Bernards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy took his arm and guided him back on the
path. Finally, a dark outline with a faint square of
light in the center of it loomed up before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; Sandy shouted above the wind.
&ldquo;Home at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only the boys back at Valley View High
could see us now,&rdquo; Jerry yelled in his ear.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be something to drop that Pepper
March out here some night? Boy! Or better yet,
let&rsquo;s drop him into a den of those Kodiak bears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy laughed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which of the two
is more ornery. He might scare them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the cabin door, and Sandy leaned
against it and pushed it open. They staggered
inside and slammed it shut behind them. The
interior of the one-room shack was dark, except
for the logs burning low and evenly on the open
hearth.</p>
<p>Sandy blinked to accustom his eyes to the dimness.
&ldquo;I could have sworn there was a light in the
window as we came along the path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the reflection of the flames on the
panes,&rdquo; Jerry suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Well, let&rsquo;s light a lamp.&rdquo; Sandy took
several steps toward a table silhouetted against the
firelight, then stopped suddenly. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he said
in a startled voice, nudging an object on the floor
with his boot. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this junk spread all over the
floor? Looks like somebody was breaking up house.
I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off as a dark shape materialized
from the shadows in the far corner of the
cabin and seemed to glide toward him. At the same
time, he heard Jerry&rsquo;s excited shout in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy! There&rsquo;s somebody in here. Hey, look
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy Steele, without even a consciousness of
what he was facing, reacted with his athlete&rsquo;s instinct
and reflexes. Crouching low, he braced himself
solidly, and as the figure loomed up before
him, he threw a hard body block at the middle of
it. His shoulder hit a solid form and he heard a
soft grunt of pain and anger. As his arms grappled
with the intruder, he realized for the first
time that it was a man. His fingers brushed rough
wool, and then he felt the steel fingers at his
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get help, Jerry!&rdquo; he bellowed, just before the
wind was pinched off in his throat. Then he took
a hard, numbing blow at the back of his neck and
felt himself falling ... falling ... falling ...
into blackness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER FOUR</span>
<br />Charley Works Out the Huskies</h2>
<p>When Sandy regained consciousness he was lying
flat on his back on a cot, surrounded by a ring of
anxious faces. He recognized his father, Jerry,
Professor Crowell, Lou Mayer, Superintendent
MacKensie and several other men from the maintenance
gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what happened?&rdquo; Sandy asked weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Son. You&rsquo;re fine. Just a nasty
bump on the head,&rdquo; Dr. Steele told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He really clobbered you, Sandy,&rdquo; Jerry said.
&ldquo;Then he straight-armed me and sent me flying
back over a chair. Before I could get up he was
gone in the blizzard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sense trying to follow him in this
heavy snow,&rdquo; MacKensie declared. &ldquo;His tracks
are probably covered already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he get away with anything?&rdquo; Sandy wanted
to know.</p>
<p>Dr. Steele and Professor Crowell exchanged
significant glances. Then the Canadian geologist
said hurriedly, &ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t steal a thing. Probably
some renegade trapper looking for guns and
ammunition. They prey on unwary travelers, these
chaps. I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s wanted by the Mounties as it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Superintendent MacKensie looked puzzled.
&ldquo;He certainly was a queer one, all right. He really
messed things up. But, now, what do you suppose
he was after in that stuff?&rdquo; He pointed to an open
valise in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>Sandy propped himself up on one elbow and
saw that Professor Crowell&rsquo;s notebooks and papers
were scattered all about the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have thought you had money hidden
between the pages,&rdquo; Lou Mayer said quickly.</p>
<p>Superintendent MacKensie scratched his head.
&ldquo;I dunno. It beats me. We&rsquo;ve never had anything
like this happen before. There have been hijackings
on the highway, but no one&rsquo;s ever had the
nerve to break in here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no harm done,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said. &ldquo;And
Sandy will be as good as new after a night&rsquo;s sleep.
I suggest we clean this mess up and turn in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others agreed, and while Sandy rested on
the cot they began to gather up their scattered belongings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he got at the rest of the stuff we
left in the station wagon,&rdquo; Professor Crowell said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Superintendent MacKensie said.
&ldquo;Your wagon is in the shed with our scout plane
and the heavy machinery. We&rsquo;ve had men working
out there all evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the cabin was in order, MacKensie and his
men said good night and went back to the main
barracks. As they were undressing before the fire,
Dr. Steele questioned Sandy casually but with
painstaking thoroughness about his encounter
with the intruder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he a big man?&rdquo; the doctor asked. &ldquo;Did you
get a look at his face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy shook his head. &ldquo;It was too dark to see
much of anything. All I know is that he was big,
taller than me, and husky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That goes for me, too,&rdquo; Jerry agreed. &ldquo;For all
I know it could have been Tagish Charley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Crowell dropped the boot he was
holding with a loud clatter. &ldquo;What did you say,
boy?&rdquo; he asked in a tense voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Jerry laughed nervously at the professor&rsquo;s obvious
dismay. &ldquo;I mean he was big like Charley.
Of course it wasn&rsquo;t Charley. Heck, it could have
been that big French cook. All I know is that he
was big and strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said suddenly, &ldquo;where
<i>is</i> Charley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one answered for a long moment. Then
Sandy said, &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s still out with the dogs. Or
maybe he&rsquo;s back swapping stories with the old-timers
in the barracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as Lou Mayer was about to turn down the
lamp, after the others were all in bed, the cabin
door swung in and Tagish Charley tramped into
the room. His hood and parka were encrusted
with snow and ice, as were his boots and trousers.
He looked as if he had been out in the storm for
a long time. In the crook of his left arm he held
a rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good lord, Charley!&rdquo; the professor exclaimed,
sitting upright on his cot. &ldquo;Where have you been,
man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The Indian walked over to the fireplace and
shook himself like a great dog. Carefully he
leaned the rifle against the wall and shrugged out
of his parka. &ldquo;I drink coffee in kitchen with
Frenchy when man run in and say someone break
into this cabin. I take rifle and follow him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this storm!&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;You could have
gotten lost and frozen to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley grunted and tapped a finger to his
temple. &ldquo;Indian have thing up here like pigeon.
Always find way home. Bad man have sled and
dogs waiting in trees. No use follow him. If snow
stop in morning, maybe I look around some
more.&rdquo; He kicked off his boots, stepped out of his
wet trousers and spread them out over the back of
a chair near the fire. Then, like a big animal, he
padded across the floor to an empty bunk. Seconds
after his head hit the pillow, the rafters shook
from his mooselike snores.</p>
<p>Jerry leaned over the side of his top-deck wall
bunk and grinned at Sandy in the bunk underneath.
&ldquo;Now I know those guys up in Tibet are all
wet. There isn&rsquo;t any Abominable Snowman. They
bumped into Tagish Charley when he was out for
one of his evening strolls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned back, but it was a weak grin. He
was bothered alternately by twinges of suspicion
and pangs of guilt. It <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> be Charley; he
<i>knew</i> it! Yet, anything was possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The snow stopped during the night and a high-pressure
area moved into the vicinity. Morning
brought clear blue skies and bright sun. But the
air was still dry and frosty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, only about seven inches fell,&rdquo; Superintendent
MacKensie told them at breakfast.
&ldquo;By the time you folks are on your way, the highway
will be slick as a whistle. Our patrol plane&rsquo;s
scouting back in the direction of Dawson Creek
to see if any motorcars are in trouble. If anyone
was on the road when that snow started coming
down real hard, they would have had to sit it out
overnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;re still here when the plane gets
back,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see how they land
those babies on skis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, it&rsquo;s smoother than landing on
wheels,&rdquo; Professor Crowell told him. &ldquo;I know I
prefer them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have your own plane, Professor?&rdquo;
Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. In wild, big country like this, planes
are more common than family cars, and far more
practical. In the summertime almost every lake
you pass on your way north looks something like
a supermarket parking field. Private planes, all
sizes and shapes and makes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Jerry whistled. &ldquo;Boy, that&rsquo;s the life. Can you
imagine how that would be back in Valley View?
I can just hear myself saying to my father, &lsquo;Hey,
Pop, I got a heavy date tonight. Can I have the
keys to the plane?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men laughed and Professor Crowell said,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not as much of a joke as you think. My
daughters are always flying up to Edmonton to
shop for their new spring outfits and Easter
bonnets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry looked wistful. &ldquo;Gee, it must be more fun
being a kid up here than it is in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele smiled. &ldquo;It certainly must be more
exciting in some ways. Then again, I suspect that
youngsters like you and Sandy would miss your
malt shops, drive-ins and television.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have television here,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Superintendent MacKensie admitted,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s pretty limited compared to what you
Americans can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were intrigued by the heavy, thick
flapjacks that Frenchy the cook served with thick
slabs of bacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They taste different than what my maw
makes,&rdquo; Jerry commented. &ldquo;Sort of sour.&rdquo; Then,
with an apologetic glance at the big, bushy-headed
cook, &ldquo;But I love &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Superintendent MacKensie&rsquo;s eyes twinkled.
&ldquo;You may not believe it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the fermented
yeast dough that went into these flapjacks
is over sixty years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry choked in the middle of a bite and swallowed
hard. &ldquo;Sixty years old! You&rsquo;re kidding, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least. It was handed down to
Frenchy by his father, who was a gold prospector
up in the Yukon in the eighteen-nineties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; Jerry laid down his fork. &ldquo;Talk about
hoarders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele laughed. &ldquo;Sourdough, of course.
Those old prospectors got their nickname from it.
You boys have heard of sourdoughs, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Jerry admitted. &ldquo;I just never knew
where the name came from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sourdough was the prospector&rsquo;s staff of life on
the trail,&rdquo; Superintendent MacKensie explained.
&ldquo;Once he got the mixture just right, he&rsquo;d keep it
in a tightly closed container and add to it as he
used it. But the culture always remained the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeast is like a fungus,&rdquo; Professor Crowell
elaborated for the boys&rsquo; benefit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s composed of
living, growing cells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the superintendent went on. &ldquo;This particular
strain in the flapjacks we&rsquo;re eating has been
kept alive for sixty years by Frenchy&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui</i>,&rdquo; the cook spoke from the end of the table.
&ldquo;My <i>papa</i> give some of this sourdough to all his
sons and daughters when they leave home. I give
to my son some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazing,&rdquo; said Lou Mayer.</p>
<p>Frenchy stood up and swung a big, empty
platter up on one hand. &ldquo;I go make some more,
no?&rdquo; He looked down at Jerry. &ldquo;You eat five or
six more, hey, boy? They very small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry attacked the last flapjack on his plate with
renewed relish. &ldquo;A couple more anyway, Frenchy.
And maybe another slab of that bacon.&rdquo; He
winked as Sandy began to groan. &ldquo;Who knows, we
may get stranded for days in a blizzard without
food. I&rsquo;m storing up energy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After breakfast, Sandy and Jerry went outside
and watched Tagish Charley work out the huskies
on the landing strip off to one side of the road
station. The dog sled was about ten feet long with
a welded aluminum frame and polished steel
runners. Extending halfway down both sides, were
guard rails to which baggage could be strapped.
There was a small footrest at the rear, where the
sled driver could ride standing erect, and a rubber-coated
handrail for him to grip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The dogs milled about excitedly as Charley
harnessed them to the sled. They were hitched up
in staggered formation, one dog&rsquo;s head abreast
of the haunches of the dog in front of him.
Black Titan led the pack, and the driving reins
were attached only to his harness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead dog, he have to be very smart,&rdquo; Charley
told them, ruffling up the thick fur collar around
Titan&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;He boss of team. Not driver.
Other dogs do bad job, he scold them. Sometimes
he have to fight a bad dog who make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Professor Crowell&rsquo;s team has a
chance to win the race from Whitehorse to Skagway?&rdquo;
Sandy asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We win,&rdquo; Charley said matter-of-factly. &ldquo;Best
team, best lead dog.&rdquo; He patted Titan&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;Black Titan pull sled all alone if he have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the professor going to drive himself, Charley?&rdquo;
Jerry inquired curiously.</p>
<p>The Indian shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Better he
not drive in race. Professor fine dog driver, but
safer if he not drive this race. On trail easy for
bad men to get him. Better for Charley to drive
team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charley,&rdquo; Sandy asked worriedly, &ldquo;do you
have any idea why the bad men are after Professor
Crowell? Why would anyone want to harm a nice
man like him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Anger tightened Charley&rsquo;s features. &ldquo;Professor
got something they want very bad. They kill him
if they have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>what</i> do they want? What is it the professor
has that&rsquo;s so valuable to them? Money?
Jewels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley shook his head. &ldquo;Professor no have
money or jewels. Maybe something he have in
here.&rdquo; He tapped his finger against his forehead
wisely.</p>
<p>Sandy looked at Jerry. &ldquo;You know, he could
have something there. I think I&rsquo;m going to have
a man-to-man talk with my dad first chance I get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys rode on the sled as ballast while
Charley put the powerful team through its paces,
whizzing back and forth on the hard-packed surface
of the landing strip and churning through
high drifts in the virgin snow around the fringes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Jerry yelled in Sandy&rsquo;s ear, clutching
the guard rail with one hand and, with his other
hand, protecting his face from the spray of snow
flung back by the dogs&rsquo; flying feet. &ldquo;This is better
than the roller coaster at Disneyland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy nodded vigorously. &ldquo;That Titan is fantastic,
isn&rsquo;t he? He acts almost human.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Seemingly aware of his admiring audience,
Black Titan put on an impressive display. Setting
a pace for his teammates that kept their tongues
lolling from their black-roofed mouths, he guided
them smoothly into sharp turns and sudden twists
and broke trail through muzzle-high snow with
his broad chest as if it were light as dust&mdash;all the
time responsive to the slightest tug at the reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a marvel, all right,&rdquo; Sandy told Charley
later when the dogs were resting after their work-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, would I ever like to get into that big race.
You don&rsquo;t need any passengers, do you, Charley?&rdquo;
Jerry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay for you boys to come along. Need five
hundred pounds on sled anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was overjoyed. &ldquo;You mean it, Charley?
Really? Jerry and I can ride ballast on the sled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. You ask professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that minute, Dr. Steele came walking across
the landing strip toward them. &ldquo;You fellows about
ready to leave? It&rsquo;s nine-thirty. Superintendent
MacKensie has had our vehicles warming up for
almost half an hour now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy spoke to Jerry in a low voice. &ldquo;You help
Charley get the dogs in the truck. I want to talk
to my dad&mdash;in private.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER FIVE</span>
<br />Christmas in the Wilderness</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Sandy began haltingly as they walked
slowly back to the barracks, &ldquo;Professor Crowell is
in some kind of trouble, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele was evasive. &ldquo;You mean because of
that man who broke into our cabin? What makes
you think that had anything to do with the professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy looked earnestly into his father&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;That was no ordinary thief, Dad. He was after
something in Professor Crowell&rsquo;s notes and
papers.&rdquo; His face became even graver. &ldquo;Maybe
they&rsquo;re after you, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele tried to laugh it off, but his mirth was
hollow. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you becoming a little melodramatic,
Son?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t fool me for a minute, Dad. I know
that whatever&rsquo;s going on is probably top-secret
government business and you can&rsquo;t tell me what
it&rsquo;s all about. But I do think it&rsquo;s only fair to tell me
whether or not you or the professor or Lou Mayer
are in any danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele appeared to think it over very carefully.
Finally, he sighed. &ldquo;Yes, I guess you&rsquo;re right.
I brought you boys along, so I don&rsquo;t suppose I have
any right to keep you completely in the dark. The
fact is we <i>are</i> in danger&mdash;all of us. I had no right
to expose you boys&mdash;especially Jerry&mdash;to this kind
of thing, but I thought at first we could deceive
<i>them</i> into believing that this was just a routine
geological survey. I was wrong. They&rsquo;re far too
clever.&rdquo; His mouth tightened. &ldquo;Maybe the best
thing to do would be to send you and Jerry back
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Sandy looked hurt. &ldquo;Not on your life. If
you&rsquo;re in any kind of trouble, I&rsquo;m sticking with
you until you&rsquo;re out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele frowned. &ldquo;I wish I could tell you
more about this, Sandy, but I&rsquo;m bound by an oath
of secrecy. You&rsquo;ll just have to trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;As for Jerry James, I think it&rsquo;s only fair for you
to tell him what I&rsquo;ve told you and let him decide
whether he wants to continue on with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask him,&rdquo; Sandy agreed. &ldquo;But I know what
he&rsquo;s going to say right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were almost at the front door of the barracks
now. &ldquo;One more thing, Dad,&rdquo; Sandy said.
&ldquo;Tagish Charley. I like him an awful lot. You
don&rsquo;t think that he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he&rsquo;s the one who ransacked our cabin last
night?&rdquo; the doctor finished for him. &ldquo;The same
thought flashed through my mind, too. I just can&rsquo;t
believe it, though. Charley&rsquo;s been with the professor
for years; he&rsquo;s like one of the family. Still&mdash;&rdquo;
his face went grim&mdash;&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t really know&mdash;and
we can&rsquo;t afford to take chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Superintendent MacKensie greeted them as
they entered the building. &ldquo;Your wagons are all
set to roll,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>Sandy took his friend aside just before they
left the station and repeated what his father had
said, offering Jerry the choice of going back to
Valley View.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to slug you,&rdquo; the husky, dark-haired
boy roared, his black eyes flashing, his square
jaw jutting out defiantly, &ldquo;for even thinking I&rsquo;d
back out on you when you were in trouble! What
kind of a guy do you think I am?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, Buster.&rdquo; Sandy threw his arm
around his friend&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;I told Dad that&rsquo;s
exactly what you would say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">They made good time all that morning, and a
little after one o&rsquo;clock they reached Fort Nelson.
Here they ate lunch with the Game Commissioner,
an old friend of Professor Crowell&rsquo;s.
Later, while the station wagon and truck were
being refueled, the boys accompanied Tagish
Charley down to the Indian village on the banks
of the frozen Nelson River. Charley went straight
to the house of the headman in the village, and
they talked earnestly and excitedly in an Indian
dialect for some time.</p>
<p>On the way back to the truck, he told the boys:
&ldquo;That man know everything go on in province.
He say many strangers pass this way. They say they
French trappers, but they speak strange tongue
and never sell any furs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say how many?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry clapped his mittened hands together.
&ldquo;And there are five of us. Those aren&rsquo;t bad odds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a fair fight,&rdquo; Sandy corrected him. &ldquo;But
from what I&rsquo;ve heard and seen of these guys, they
probably have no idea of fighting fair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The sun went down early, but this night was
clear and the sky was full of stars, so they drove on
for quite a while after dark. At five-thirty they
came to a weather station near Lake Muncho. It
was a small place, manned by three technicians,
and although the five guests really crowded their
quarters, the weathermen were very hospitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You chaps are lucky,&rdquo; the man in charge told
them. &ldquo;This high-pressure area should be with us
for the rest of the week. You&rsquo;ll have fine weather
all the way to Alaska.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh,&rdquo; said Jerry, when he saw the small pine
tree trimmed with tinsel and colored balls and
lights that stood in one corner of the shack&rsquo;s main
room. &ldquo;I almost forgot&mdash;this is Christmas Eve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem like it, somehow,&rdquo; Sandy said,
feeling a slight twinge of homesickness. &ldquo;Not
without Mom&rsquo;s turkey dinner and presents and
Christmas carols.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas isn&rsquo;t turkey and presents and
chimes,&rdquo; Professor Crowell observed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what
you feel in the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, sir,&rdquo; Sandy admitted. Then he
grinned. &ldquo;I guess Jerry and I are still kids at
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as it should be,&rdquo; the professor said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the things I admire most about you
Americans&mdash;your boyish exuberance. You&rsquo;re always
looking for an excuse to give a party. I think
it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why you have so many national
holidays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing shy about us Canadians when it comes
to a party either,&rdquo; one of the weathermen put in.
He turned to his two partners. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s show these
Yanks a real Christmas party. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a chorus of &ldquo;ayes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a hearty meal of tinned ham, fried potatoes
and frozen candied yams, topped off by a
flaming plum pudding, they gathered in a tight
circle about the little fireplace and sipped hot
cider and nibbled marshmallows toasted in the
winking embers. About nine o&rsquo;clock the weathermen
picked up a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
program of Christmas carols on their shortwave
radio and piped it through a big hi-fi speaker
over the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is more like it,&rdquo; Jerry sighed contentedly,
stuffing himself with marshmallows and roasted
nuts, staring at the lights twinkling on the Christmas
tree and listening to the strains of &ldquo;Silent
Night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele grinned mysteriously. &ldquo;And who
knows, maybe Santa will find you boys even up
here. Better pin up your stockings before you go
to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>There were only two extra cots at the weather
station, so the boys, Lou Mayer and Tagish Charley
bedded down in their sleeping bags around
the fireplace. Just before he turned in, Charley
fed the dogs and let them run for a while on the
deserted highway. Then he penned them in on the
big front porch of the weather station.</p>
<p>Sandy fell asleep as soon as his head touched the
pillow, and the next thing he knew, sunlight was
streaming into his eyes. Yawning, he sat up and
looked around. Tagish Charley and Lou Mayer
were already up and off somewhere. Only Jerry
was still asleep, curled up in his sleeping bag like
a hibernating bear.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s eyes widened as they came to rest on the
little Christmas tree in the corner. Beneath it were
piled assorted boxes wrapped in gaily colored
tissue and tied with tinseled ribbon. He leaned
over and shook his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Jerry, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry snorted and opened his eyes, heavy-lidded
with sleep. &ldquo;Whazza matter?&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>Sandy grinned. &ldquo;Looks like Santa was here
while we were asleep. C&rsquo;mon, get up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Sandy rolled out of his sleeping bag, put on his
trousers, shirt and boots and went over to the
tree. Kneeling down, he read the tags on the packages:
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>To Sandy from Dad</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>To Jerry....</i>&rsquo; Hey!
There&rsquo;s something here for everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up and saw his father, Professor
Crowell and Lou Mayer standing in the doorway
that led into the tiny kitchen. They were all
smiling broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t just sit there,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said.
&ldquo;Pass them around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Sandy had observed, there was something
for everyone. An intricate chronometer wrist watch
that told the days of the month and even the phases
of the moon for Sandy; a candid camera for Jerry;
a gold fountain pen for Lou Mayer; and a fine
steel hunting knife with a silver inlaid handle for
Tagish Charley. Professor Crowell, with genuine
Yuletide spirit, gave a set of ivory chessmen he
had bought from an Indian at Fort Nelson to the
three weathermen. They, in turn, presented the
professor and Dr. Steele each with a pair of fine
snowshoes.</p>
<p>After they had burned the wrappings in the fire,
Sandy remarked rather sadly, &ldquo;Gee, Dad, now I
wish I hadn&rsquo;t left your present back home. But
Mom said we&rsquo;d save all the gifts till we got back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Dr. Steele put his arm around his son&rsquo;s shoulders.
&ldquo;Sandy, the best present you could ever give
me is just being here.&rdquo; He reached for Jerry with
his other arm. &ldquo;That goes for you too, Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Right after breakfast, they said goodbye to their
new friends and headed north again. They drove
into Watson Lake, just across the border in Yukon
territory, about two o&rsquo;clock. Watson Lake was one
of the largest towns along the Alaska Highway. In
addition to a Mountie station and an R.C.A.F.
base, there was an airstrip for commercial airlines
and accommodations for putting up passengers
overnight. They drove straight out to the air force
base, where the sentry ushered them through the
gate with a snappy salute as soon as Professor
Crowell identified himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old prof really rates in these parts, doesn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; Jerry mused, as they drove through the precisely
laid-out checkerboard streets past neat log-cabin
barracks to the HQ building.</p>
<p>They were even more impressed by the reception
the professor received from the Base Commander,
an old friend he had worked with in
World War II.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in time for Christmas dinner,&rdquo; the
Commander told them happily. &ldquo;Roast turkey
with all the trimmings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Jerry rubbed his stomach gleefully. &ldquo;This stands
to be the best holiday season of our lives, Sandy.
Wherever we go people give us Christmas dinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The geologists decided to stop over at Watson
Lake and get an early start the next morning for
the long, grueling uphill drive over the divide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the divide?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A high shelf on the continent that determines
the direction of water drainage,&rdquo; Dr. Steele explained.
&ldquo;In the case of North America, it&rsquo;s the
Rocky Mountains. All the rivers and streams on
one side of the Rockies run in a generally easterly
direction; on the other side they flow to the west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we have any trouble driving up those
mountains with all this snow and ice?&rdquo; Sandy inquired
of the R.C.A.F. Commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a pretty tortuous route,&rdquo; the officer
admitted. &ldquo;But the ascent is fairly gradual. With
chains you shouldn&rsquo;t have too much trouble. Of
course, if it should snow again, that would be
another matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get an early start,&rdquo; Professor Crowell
told them. &ldquo;About six <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER SIX</span>
<br />Attack from the Air</h2>
<p>It was gray and cold when they left Watson Lake
on the last leg of their journey on the Alaska
Highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Whitehorse, we&rsquo;ll give the car and truck a
rest and take to the air,&rdquo; Dr. Steele explained.
&ldquo;The Canadian government has put a plane at
the professor&rsquo;s disposal for as long as we&rsquo;re up
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the big attraction at Whitehorse as far as the
boys and Tagish Charley were concerned was the
big dog-sled race to Skagway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor says it&rsquo;s okay with him if Jerry
and I ride ballast,&rdquo; Sandy informed the Indian.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s all right with you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Okay by me,&rdquo; Charley said. He glanced sideways
at Jerry. &ldquo;But this boy keep eating so much
he get too fat to sit on sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy let out a guffaw and Jerry pretended to
sulk. &ldquo;You guys have a nerve,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You both
lick your plates cleaner than Black Titan does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Tubby, here, is too much of a load for the
huskies,&rdquo; Sandy suggested, &ldquo;we can always let him
run behind the sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Charley hunched down and squinted
through the windshield. &ldquo;Plane,&rdquo; he announced
curtly.</p>
<p>The boys followed his gaze but could see nothing.
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>Charley pointed toward a line of snow-capped
mountain peaks in the distance surrounded by
blue haze. Sandy saw a speck that moved out of
sight behind one of the peaks. He couldn&rsquo;t make
out what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it wasn&rsquo;t a bird?&rdquo; he said uncertainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It plane,&rdquo; Charley said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s from one of the road stations,&rdquo; Jerry
suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Sandy said and pushed down a little
harder on the accelerator to close the gap between
them and the station wagon, which had
drawn about a quarter of a mile ahead.</p>
<p>Gradually the road climbed, winding and twisting
through canyons and hugging mountainsides
in hazardous stretches. At one such spot Jerry
peered down into the chasm that dropped off
steeply on one side and clapped his hands over his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll get out and walk the rest of the
way,&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s face was grim as he nursed the big truck
around the curves, never letting the speedometer
needle climb above the 30 on the dial.</p>
<p>Then, without warning, a great throbbing roar
bore down on them from the rear. Instinctively,
they ducked their heads as it seemed to shatter
the roof of the cab. An instant later a plane
appeared through the windshield zooming down
the road toward the station wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yipes!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed. &ldquo;What does he think
he&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crazy fool!&rdquo; Sandy said angrily. &ldquo;He could
have scared us off the highway. Look at him! He
can&rsquo;t be more than fifty feet off the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little ship skimmed over the station wagon
and started to climb in a wide arc.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s a scout plane from one of the
road stations?&rdquo; Jerry said anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sandy replied, trying to keep
one eye on the road and the other on the circling
plane. &ldquo;It looks as if he&rsquo;s coming back again.&rdquo;
Gratefully, he noted that they were approaching
a less treacherous section of highway.</p>
<p>Once more they heard the little plane gunning
its motor at top speed as it flew up behind them.
As it passed over them, a small round hole appeared,
as if by magic, at the top of their windshield.</p>
<p>For a moment they were too stunned to react,
then Jerry yelled, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re shooting at us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an unintelligible oath, Tagish Charley
whirled in the seat and reached back through the
curtain partition into the rear of the truck.
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he told Sandy as he pulled out his hunting
rifle.</p>
<p>As Sandy brought the lumbering vehicle to a
skidding halt at the side of the road, he saw that
the station wagon had pulled up also, and the
three geologists were piling out frantically.</p>
<p>Tagish Charley motioned to a patch of timber
about a hundred yards away. &ldquo;Go&mdash;fast.&rdquo; The
three of them floundered through knee-deep drifts
as the engine roar of the plane built up in their ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Down!&rdquo; Charley bellowed. &ldquo;Flat!&rdquo; As the boys
flattened out, the Indian turned, dropped to one
knee and threw the rifle to his shoulder. He
squeezed off two shots, leading the plane as if it
were a wild duck. In return, a fusillade of shots
from the plane kicked up the snow all around
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those guys really mean business!&rdquo; Jerry
yelled as they scrambled to their feet and ran for
the woods again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is like one of those nightmares where
you&rsquo;re being chased by a wild animal and your legs
move in slow motion,&rdquo; Sandy gasped, churning
through the snow.</p>
<p>They reached the trees just before the plane
swooped over them again. Crouching behind a
tree bole, Charley emptied his rifle at the retreating
ship. A slug splattered the bark just above his
head.</p>
<p>This time as the plane climbed, a thin spiral of
smoke trailed back from the engine, and the
rhythm of the motor was uneven.</p>
<p>Sandy let out a cheer. &ldquo;You got him, Charley!
Good shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Immediately the plane broke off its attack and
headed north. Sandy led the way down the road to
where the three geologists were standing by the
station wagon, watching the ship dwindle to a
speck in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you okay, Dad?&rdquo; he yelled anxiously.
&ldquo;Anybody hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just badly frightened,&rdquo; Dr. Steele replied.
&ldquo;How about you fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No casualties,&rdquo; Sandy reported breathlessly.
&ldquo;Just a bullet hole in the windshield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems as if Charley saved the day,&rdquo; Professor
Crowell said. He took one of the Indian&rsquo;s big
hands in both of his. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you decided to
come along, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley gave him one of his rare, quick smiles.
&ldquo;Bad men try hurt you&mdash;&rdquo; He paused and drew a
finger across his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like I said before,&rdquo; Jerry declared, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
he&rsquo;s on our side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian cocked his head toward the truck,
where the dogs were setting up a raucous clamor.
&ldquo;I go see if huskies okay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Lou Mayer shivered and hugged his arms
tightly around his body. &ldquo;And to think I could
have been a teacher in a nice cozy classroom in
some peaceful college in the balmy South instead
of shooting it out with enemy agents in the
Yukon&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short and looked guiltily
at Dr. Steele. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir. That just slipped
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Lou,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said. &ldquo;I think
by now the boys have a pretty good idea of what
we&rsquo;re up against.&rdquo; Sensing the question that was
forming in Sandy&rsquo;s mind, he added hastily, &ldquo;But
for the present, at least, that&rsquo;s all we can tell you.&rdquo;
As Lou and the professor were getting back into
the station wagon, he whispered to his son, &ldquo;At
least this little incident answers our question
about Charley, once and for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure does,&rdquo; Sandy agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you
later, Dad.&rdquo; He and Jerry turned and trudged
back to the truck.</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s voice was small and numb. &ldquo;Wow! Enemy
agents! Wow! Wait till the guys hear about
this!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER SEVEN</span>
<br />The Big Race</h2>
<p>They rolled into Whitehorse late that night.
The boys were surprised to find a fairly modern
city with paved streets, rows of stores and shops
and street lamps. As they drove down the main
street, festively decorated with wreaths, colored
lights and holly, Jerry shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it looks pretty much like Valley View.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They even have bowling alleys,&rdquo; Sandy
pointed out. &ldquo;And neon signs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Later, as they ate supper in the hotel dining
room, Dr. Steele told them about the origin of the
city: &ldquo;Whitehorse was born in the gold rush, when
thousands of sourdoughs trekked over the mountains
from Alaska and the Pacific ports to seek
their fortunes. Whitehorse was sort of a jumping-off
place. They ran the rapids to Lake Laberge in
anything that would float&mdash;barges, rafts, scows&mdash;and
on down the Yukon River to Dawson. A few of
them struck bonanzas, but most of them found
only poverty and disillusionment. There&rsquo;s just no
way to get rich quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re right, Dr. Steele,&rdquo; Jerry remarked.
&ldquo;Though I was kind of hoping that Sandy
and I could strike out north with Professor Crowell&rsquo;s
dog team and stake ourselves a claim. That
French cook back at the road station even gave me
a jar of that sourdough of his to get us started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Crowell laughed. &ldquo;Before you boys
do anything like that, you had better see how you
stand up to the rigors of the trail during the big
race to Skagway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day after tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley gulped down a small roll with one bite.
&ldquo;Tomorrow we give huskies plenty exercise. Not
much to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy frowned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to starve them
before the race? Won&rsquo;t it weaken them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley grunted. &ldquo;No starve. Huskies can go
week without food. They little hungry, they run
faster and fight harder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you, Lou and Professor Crowell going
to be doing the rest of this week?&rdquo; Sandy asked
his father as they left the table.</p>
<p>His father thought about it a minute before
answering. &ldquo;Well, tomorrow we thought we&rsquo;d fly
up to Fairbanks and visit the University of Alaska.
The president&rsquo;s an old friend of mine. We hope
to inspect some of the fossils they&rsquo;ve dug up lately.
I understand they have some fine specimens on
display.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I wish we could come with you,&rdquo; Sandy
said. &ldquo;That sounds like interesting stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jerry agreed. &ldquo;We kids in the States
never get to see things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s not so, Jerry,&rdquo; Professor Crowell
objected. &ldquo;Your American museums and universities
contain some of the most fascinating specimens
of prehistoric beasts that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.
The last time I visited the American Museum of
Natural History in New York I saw the leg of a
baby mammoth that was completely intact. It had
been preserved for centuries in a glacier, and the
museum kept it in a deep freeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor&rsquo;s right, Jerry,&rdquo; Sandy admitted.
&ldquo;The trouble with so many of the kids we know is
that they&rsquo;re too lazy to use their eyes and their
ears&mdash;and their legs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Dr. Steele interrupted. &ldquo;As a matter of fact,
did either of you boys know that Black Bart, the
notorious stagecoach bandit, is reputed to have
buried a strongbox with $40,000 in gold in the
hills back of Stockton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, no!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed. &ldquo;What do you say,
Sandy? Let&rsquo;s go on a treasure hunt next summer.
That&rsquo;s practically in our back yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Crowell smiled. &ldquo;That beats digging
for gold in the Yukon, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will you be in Fairbanks?&rdquo; Sandy
wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no more than a day,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said. &ldquo;We
want to get back to Skagway to see you fellows
come across the finish line in the big race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In first place, of course,&rdquo; Jerry added smugly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a treat,&rdquo; Professor Crowell
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I think we should all go up to our rooms
and get a good night&rsquo;s sleep,&rdquo; Dr. Steele suggested.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a long, trying day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds good to me,&rdquo; Lou Mayer seconded.
&ldquo;It will be a real pleasure to rest my weary
bones on an honest-to-goodness bed with a soft
mattress.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;You chaps go ahead,&rdquo; said Professor Crowell.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down the street to the police barracks
and report that incident with the plane today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think that&rsquo;s wise?&rdquo; Dr. Steele
asked gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief constable is a reliable man,&rdquo; the
professor told him. &ldquo;He can be depended upon to
be discreet. He may have received a report from
one of these local airstrips about a small plane
making an emergency landing. I don&rsquo;t think those
fellows could have traveled too far with their engine
smoking like that. If they did land near here,
we can put our people on their track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele nodded. &ldquo;Good idea. Do you want
me to come with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be necessary,&rdquo; the older man assured
him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Charley along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upstairs, when the boys had bathed and
changed into their pajamas, they lay in the dark
in the small hotel room they shared and discussed
the events of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think it&rsquo;s all about, anyway?&rdquo;
Jerry wondered. &ldquo;We know enemy agents are
after the professor. But why? It&rsquo;s not like he was
an atomic scientist or something. What could they
want with a plain old geology professor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sandy said worriedly. &ldquo;But it
must have something to do with our reason for
coming up to Alaska. You can bet my dad and the
professor didn&rsquo;t make the trip <i>just</i> to look at fossils
and take soil samples. Well, we&rsquo;ll just have
to wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Br-r-r,&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like walking through
a haunted house on Halloween Eve. You don&rsquo;t
know what to expect. But whatever it is, you know
it won&rsquo;t be good.&rdquo; He threw back the covers and
got out of bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, where are you going?&rdquo; Sandy demanded.</p>
<p>Jerry padded across the room barefoot. &ldquo;I just
want to make sure that door is locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The day of the big race was bitter cold and the
sky was leaden with snow clouds scudding across
the mountain peaks around Whitehorse. A huge
crowd had gathered at the starting line on the
outskirts of the city, and the air rang with merry
voices and the yelping of dogs. Sandy and Jerry
huddled close to a big bonfire outside the officials&rsquo;
tent while Tagish Charley made a last-minute
check of the sled and the dogs&rsquo; harnesses.</p>
<p>One of the judges came up and spoke to Sandy.
&ldquo;I understand you boys are from the States. What
do you think of our big country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very exciting, sir,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very cold,&rdquo; Jerry added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The judge laughed. &ldquo;Wait until you&rsquo;re out on
the trail a few hours. Then you&rsquo;ll know how cold
it is. You&rsquo;re riding with Professor Crowell&rsquo;s
team, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. And we&rsquo;re really looking forward to
it. This is some big event, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air was charged with a holiday atmosphere.
Men and women were laughing and singing as
they sipped from steaming mugs of coffee and tea;
and a few were drinking from mugs that Sandy
suspected contained even stronger brew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The race from Whitehorse is a time-honored
ritual,&rdquo; the judge told them. &ldquo;Back in the old
days, the course was even longer. From Dawson to
Skagway, almost six hundred miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;Those poor dogs
must have worn their legs down to the shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; the judge went on, &ldquo;Klondike
Mike Mahoney used to operate a mail and
freight route from Skagway to Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was Klondike Mike Mahoney?&rdquo; Sandy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rather fantastic young man who came to the
Yukon during the gold rush and became a living
legend.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;You might say he was our
counterpart of your Davy Crockett.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! What are they doing?&rdquo; Jerry pointed to
a group of Eskimos who were laughing and
whooping as they catapulted an Eskimo girl high
into the air from a large animal hide stretched
taut like a fireman&rsquo;s net.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of their favorite games,&rdquo; the judge
said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve probably played something like it
at the beach&mdash;tossing a boy up in a blanket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;But not like <i>that</i>. She&rsquo;s
better than some acrobats I&rsquo;ve seen on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time after time, the slender Eskimo girl shot
into the air, as high as twenty-five feet, like an
arrow, never losing her balance. While they were
watching her, Tagish Charley joined them by the
fire. In his one hand he held a sheet of oiled paper
on which were spread a half-dozen cubes that
looked like the slabs of chocolate and vanilla ice
cream served in ice-cream parlors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat,&rdquo; Charley said, offering them to the boys.</p>
<p>Sandy took one gingerly. &ldquo;Looks good. But
what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Muk-tuk</i>,&rdquo; the Indian grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Northern delicacy,&rdquo; the judge said with a
straight face.</p>
<p>Jerry stuffed one of the cubes into his mouth
with gusto. &ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s good. Tastes like coconut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy nibbled at his with more reserve. &ldquo;It
does a little. Maybe a little oilier. What&rsquo;s it made
of?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whale skin and blubber,&rdquo; the judge informed
him. &ldquo;The white part is blubber, and the dark is
hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry gagged momentarily, swallowed his last
mouthful, then smiled manfully. &ldquo;I wish you
hadn&rsquo;t said that, sir,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;But it still
tastes good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ready now?&rdquo; Charley asked the boys.
&ldquo;Time for race soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands with the official and followed
Charley over to the starting line, where the teams
were lining up.</p>
<p>There were eight entries altogether. The dogs
were prancing about restlessly in their harnesses
like proud race horses, their curved tails waving
over their backs. They were charged with excitement
and seemed eager to get started. The huskies
on opposing teams eyed each other sullenly,
baring their long fangs and growling deep in their
throats. Occasionally, one would dart out of line
and snap at another dog, but there were no fights.
Black Titan, like the good lead dog he was,
watched his team closely, and whenever one of
them became too frisky and pugnacious, he would
bark a sharp command. Immediately, the offender
would drop his ears and quiet down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They act almost human,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; Jerry agreed. &ldquo;That Titan reminds
me of Mr. Hall, my math teacher. No horseplay
when he&rsquo;s around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley helped the boys arrange themselves in
the sled, Sandy in back, with Jerry in front of him,
sitting between his legs. &ldquo;Just like on a toboggan,&rdquo;
Sandy observed. They tucked the big robe
that covered them around their sides as Charley
took his place behind the sled and gripped the
handles.</p>
<p>The sharp crack of the starter&rsquo;s pistol split the
crisp air and Charley&rsquo;s bellowing &ldquo;Mush! Yea,
huskies, mush!&rdquo; almost split Sandy&rsquo;s eardrums.
The figures lined up on both sides of them
blurred rapidly as the sled picked up speed, and
wind and snow whipped into their faces. Gripping
the handles tightly, Charley matched the
pace of the team effortlessly with his long strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not going to run all the way, is he?&rdquo; Jerry
yelled to Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he wants to give the team the best of it
this early in the race. He&rsquo;ll hop on when he gets
winded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>But a half hour went by and still the driver&rsquo;s
boots pounded behind them in unbroken rhythm.
At first the seven teams were bunched pretty close
together on the hard-packed trail, then gradually
the distance between them widened. Sandy kept
glancing back as Charley urged their sled into the
lead and finally lost sight of the nearest team as
they rounded a hummock and entered a stretch of
forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we keep this pace up, we&rsquo;ll be in Skagway
in time for lunch,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>The big Indian reined in the dogs when they
reached a spot where three separate narrower
paths forked off the main trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way do we go?&rdquo; Sandy called to him.</p>
<p>Still breathing as easily as if he had taken a
short walk around the block, Charley answered,
&ldquo;All go to Skagway. We take middle trail. More
snow, but less up and down.&rdquo; Having made up his
mind, Charley shouted to the dogs: &ldquo;Mush!
Mush! Mush, huskies!&rdquo; And they were off again.</p>
<p>A short time later they left the trail and went
skimming down a windswept slope that stretched
away into a barren icy plain. Now Charley hopped
onto the back of the sled and rode like a Roman
charioteer, shouting encouragement to the dogs in
Indian. Although there was no broken trail, the
sled rode solidly on the surface of the old snow
crusted over thickly by the 50-below-zero cold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is really living!&rdquo; Jerry exulted, his voice
trailing off eerily in the slipstream behind the
sled. At noon they stopped to rest the dogs in the
lee of a rock overhang. Sandy broke out a thermos
of steaming coffee and sandwiches, and Charley
threw the huskies some chunks of lean dry
meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far do you think we&rsquo;ve come so far?&rdquo;
Jerry asked.</p>
<p>Charley shrugged. &ldquo;Twenty, maybe twenty-five
mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s pretty good.&rdquo; He looked back in the
direction they had come from. &ldquo;Where do you
suppose those other guys are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley finished his sandwich, rumpled up the
wax-paper wrapping and set a match to it, warming
his hands over the brief torch it created. He
motioned to the west. &ldquo;Some follow other trail.
Maybe a few stay just in back of us. Let us break
new trail for them. Then when our dogs tired,
they fresh and catch us.&rdquo; He cupped one hand to
his ear. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys held their breaths for a minute,
straining to hear. They could just make out the
sound of barking dogs floating on the wind in the
distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Jerry said indignantly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
sneaky thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; Sandy disagreed. &ldquo;No more than
a track man letting another runner set the pace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worry,&rdquo; Charley assured them. &ldquo;We win
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a man you are, Charley.&rdquo; Jerry regarded
the big Indian with admiration. &ldquo;We could use
you in the fullback spot on the Valley View football
team.&rdquo; He grinned at Sandy. &ldquo;I bet he could
walk down the field with both teams on his back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley squinted up at the sky abruptly. The
ceiling seemed even lower and grayer than before.
&ldquo;It snow soon. We better go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy looked up too. &ldquo;How can you tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Charley said somberly. &ldquo;Bad storm
on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, great!&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;What happens if we
get caught out in this deep freeze in a blizzard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are check points every twenty-five
miles,&rdquo; Sandy recalled what the professor had told
him. &ldquo;We must be pretty close to one now, Charley.
Think we should stop and get a weather report?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley nodded toward the east. &ldquo;Two, three
miles over that way. On main trail. We go there,
we lose race. We stop at next post, at halfway
mark. Three hours away maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the only thing to do,&rdquo; Sandy
agreed. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get moving.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Ten minutes later, the snow began to come
down, fine granular pellets that stung like sand as
the rising wind blasted it into their faces. Visibility
was reduced to no more than fifty feet. Even
the dogs were slowed down. The snow, mixed
with the loose surface fluff of previous falls, piled
up quickly in drifts. As it dragged at his boots
more and more, Charley began to mutter angrily
to himself in Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it, Sandy,&rdquo; Jerry said uneasily.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re never going to make that check point before
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this rate we&rsquo;ll never make it at all,&rdquo; Sandy
retorted. &ldquo;Listen, Jerry, what do you say we get
out and trot along with Charley? It&rsquo;s bad enough
pulling the sled by itself without our weight too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Jerry admitted. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give the
dogs a break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy signaled Charley to stop and told him of
their plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Charley agreed. &ldquo;I go up front and
break trail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER EIGHT</span>
<br />Lost in a Blizzard</h2>
<p>For the next half hour the boys were able to
keep up with the sled. But in the ever-deepening
snow, their legs grew heavier and heavier. At last,
they lost sight of the sled in the swirling flakes.
When Jerry slipped and fell, Sandy cupped his
hands to his mouth like a megaphone and yelled:
&ldquo;Charley! Char-r-ley! Wait for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gasping for breath, Jerry struggled up to his
hands and knees. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it, Sandy,&rdquo; he gasped.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go any farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy helped his friend to get up and supported
him with one arm. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, boy, we can
make it. As soon as we catch up with the team you
can rest awhile in the sled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Clutching each other tightly, they staggered
forward, trying to follow the tracks of the sled
runners. But before they had covered twenty-five
feet, the blowing snow had obliterated the trail.
Sandy continued on doggedly in the direction he
thought the team had taken, dragging Jerry with
him. Every few steps he would stop and call:
&ldquo;Char-ley! Char-ley!&rdquo; But there was no answer&mdash;only
the moaning of the wind and the hiss of the
snow beating against the fabric of their parkas.</p>
<p>Once more Jerry sagged to his knees. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
lost, pal,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m exhausted. I
can&rsquo;t go a step farther. You go ahead and look for
Charley. When you find him, you can come back
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be crazy, Jerry. Our best chance is to
stick together. If we keep walking, we&rsquo;re bound to
catch up to the team. Once Charley finds we&rsquo;re
gone, he&rsquo;ll stop and wait for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s voice cracked. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see my hand in
front of my face. We don&rsquo;t even know if we&rsquo;re going
in the right direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking, a low, mournful howl
drifted to them on the wind from somewhere on
their left. Sandy clutched Jerry&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;You hear
that?&rdquo; he said tensely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s voice brightened. &ldquo;That must be the
team. C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo; With renewed vigor, he veered off
in the direction of the howling.</p>
<p>Sandy grabbed him with both hands. &ldquo;No,
wait! It could be a wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry stopped dead. &ldquo;Oh my gosh!&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy dusted the snow that had crusted on his
eyebrows with the back of one mitten. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know. I still think we&rsquo;re heading in the right direction.
Let&rsquo;s go a little farther. If we don&rsquo;t find
Charley and the team soon, we can always head
over that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The snow was coming down so hard now that
every breath was an effort. Sandy felt as if he were
being smothered in a sea of white cotton. He
stopped as the howling broke out again, in a chorus
this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said to Jerry. &ldquo;That
sure sounds like a bunch of dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s give it a try, anyhow,&rdquo; Jerry
pressed.</p>
<p>They were just about to veer off in the direction
of the howling when they heard a familiar
harsh rumbling directly in front of them. It was
the unmistakable growl of a husky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charley!&rdquo; Sandy called out. &ldquo;Titan! Black Titan!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>A succession of sharp yelps knifed through the
storm. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the team all right!&rdquo; Jerry cried.</p>
<p>Miraculously, their legs seemed to find new
strength, and they practically ran the rest of the
way through the knee-deep snow. Directly ahead
of them, the sled loomed out of the darkness. The
dogs, in harness, were seated on their haunches or
huddled low in drifts to escape the force of the
wind. But Charley was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Jerry sagged against the back of the sled. &ldquo;Oh
my gosh! What happened to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have doubled back to look for us and
we didn&rsquo;t see him in the storm.&rdquo; Night had deepened
the blinding downfall even more.</p>
<p>There was a tremor in Jerry&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
think the wolves got him, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they rarely attack a man. Especially with
the dogs here. Besides, Charley had a rifle.&rdquo; He
rummaged through the packs on the front of the
sled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not here, so he must have taken it with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Jerry wanted to know.
&ldquo;Go back and try to find Charley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst thing we could do,&rdquo; Sandy
said emphatically. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d get lost but good. No,
the best thing to do is to wait here until Charley
gets back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Jerry was skeptical. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure even an old
woodsman like Charley can find his way back in
this soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe if we shout to him he&rsquo;ll hear us,&rdquo; Sandy
suggested.</p>
<p>For the next ten minutes the boys pitted their
voices against the intensity of the raging storm.
But even in their own ears their shouts sounded
pitifully weak. At last they gave it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Sandy said hoarsely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just
have to wait.&rdquo; He crouched down in the lee of the
sled.</p>
<p>What seemed like hours passed and still there
was no sign of Charley. The boys could feel the
cold seeping through their heavy clothing and
stiffening their limbs. They were both badly
frightened now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy,&rdquo; Jerry pleaded, &ldquo;we just can&rsquo;t sit here
and do nothing. We&rsquo;ll freeze to death. My nose
and cheeks are numb now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy fought back the panic that was rising in
him too. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t lose our heads, we&rsquo;ll be okay,
Jerry. The way it looks now, we&rsquo;re going to have
to spend the night here. Tomorrow, they&rsquo;ll have
search parties out looking for us. I bet the rest of
the contestants are in the same boat we are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be stiff as washboards by then,&rdquo; Jerry
prophesied. &ldquo;Frozen wolf food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a nut,&rdquo; Sandy snapped. &ldquo;Now get up
and help me rig up a lean-to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lean-to?&rdquo; Jerry said wonderingly. &ldquo;What
kind of a lean-to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kind Charley says the Eskimos build on
the trail. They fasten a big hide to the side of the
sled that&rsquo;s out of the wind and peg the other side
down to the ice, or weight it down. The snow piles
up against the far side of the sled, forming a solid
windbreak, and you have yourself a cozy little
tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any hides,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have that big rug in the sled. C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s
get to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Sandy fastened the robe to the top of the
sled&rsquo;s guard rail, Jerry weighted the far side down
with a pair of snowshoes he found in the sled and
heaped up snow on top of the shoes until they
weighted down the robe securely. When they
were finished, Sandy scooped the excess snow out
from beneath the robe and they had a small lean-to
with just enough room in it to shelter two people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; Sandy said with satisfaction,
brushing off his mittens. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll unhitch the
dogs while you get our supper ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The erection of the lean-to had renewed Jerry&rsquo;s
confidence. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you have?&rdquo; he inquired flippantly.
&ldquo;Roast turkey with chestnut stuffing or a
thick steak smothered with onions and a side of
French fries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy played the game with him. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m getting
sick of that goppy stuff. How about a couple
of frozen sandwiches and a thermos of cold coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I had in mind,&rdquo; Jerry called to him
as he rummaged through the packs on the sled.
&ldquo;Are we going to feed the huskies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, get out some of that meat Charley keeps
in that big tin can up front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dogs seemed overjoyed to see Sandy. They
leaped about him, wagging their tails furiously
and barking and whining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet you guys are hungry,&rdquo; Sandy spoke to
them. &ldquo;Keep calm. Your dinner&rsquo;s coming right
up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>When he knelt beside Black Titan to remove
his harness, the big lead dog jockeyed obediently
into the proper position. As soon as he
was free, he nuzzled affectionately against the
boy&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Sandy laughed. &ldquo;That is the
coldest nose I ever felt in my life.&rdquo; He ruffled up
the thick fur around the husky&rsquo;s throat with his
fingers, and was surprised to feel the soothing
warmth deep down in the animal&rsquo;s undercoat.
&ldquo;Boy, I wish I had your fur, Titan. No wonder
you can sleep in a snow foxhole.&rdquo; He pressed both
hands against Titan&rsquo;s body gratefully. &ldquo;That feels
good, old boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry came up behind him with the can of dog
meat. &ldquo;And look what else I found.&rdquo; He held out
a bulky .45 Colt automatic. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fully loaded,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sight of the lethal-looking pistol was reassuring.
&ldquo;Dad must have given it to Charley before
we left,&rdquo; Sandy reasoned. &ldquo;He asked me if I
wanted to take a gun along, but I knew Charley
had his rifle, so I didn&rsquo;t bother. It&rsquo;s a good thing
we have it. Now maybe we can signal to Charley.
Fire a few shots in the air to let him know where
we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Jerry agreed. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got an
even better one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s send old Titan out to find his buddy.
Bet you he can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Sandy was pessimistic. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he could
pick up Charley&rsquo;s trail in a storm like this, but we
can give it a try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the dogs were gulping down their food,
the boys rummaged through Charley&rsquo;s gear until
they found a heavy wool shirt that the Indian had
recently worn. When Black Titan had finished
eating, Sandy held the shirt under his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charley, Charley,&rdquo; he kept repeating. &ldquo;Go
find Charley, Titan.&rdquo; He slapped the husky on the
rump. &ldquo;Go on, Titan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Titan began to whine as he sniffed at the shirt.
Then he trotted off into the blizzard with his head
down. When he had disappeared from sight, Jerry
turned to Sandy. &ldquo;Well, what do we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat supper and climb into our sleeping bags,
I guess. But first I want to fire a couple of shots to
see if we can signal Charley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out the heavy automatic and levered a
shell into the firing chamber. Pointing it up in
the air, he pulled the trigger. The muzzle flash
lit up the night briefly like lightning, but the shot
was muffled by the wind and thick curtain of snow.
The dogs milled around nervously and began to
bark. Sandy fired one more shot, then shoved the
gun back in the pocket of his parka.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;I bet those shots didn&rsquo;t carry over five hundred
feet. I feel as though we&rsquo;re inside a vacuum. I
don&rsquo;t want to waste any more shells until this gale
lets up a little. C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s sack in for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gathered up the sandwiches, coffee thermos,
Coleman stove and sleeping bags and crawled
into the lean-to. The blowing snow had sealed up
all the cracks and even the openings at either end
of the makeshift shelter. Sandy burrowed through
a drift at the rear of the sled to form an entranceway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This back end gets less wind,&rdquo; he explained to
Jerry.</p>
<p>The interior of the lean-to was cramped, but
seated with their backs resting against the sides
of the sled and their legs crossed in front of them,
they were not too uncomfortable. Sandy pumped
up the pressure in the one-burner gasoline stove
and lit it. He turned the wick up abnormally high
until the pale-blue flame became streaked with
yellow and began to smoke slightly. Although
this was a waste of fuel and reduced the cooking
efficiency of the stove, it provided more light and
warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is all right,&rdquo; Jerry said, grinning. &ldquo;It
reminds me of the time we went on a Boy Scout
camping trip and slept in pup tents.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Sandy grinned. &ldquo;The only difference was we
were only a ten-minute walk away from home and
there was a hot-dog stand across the road from the
bivouac area.&rdquo; He took a half-frozen sandwich out
of the knapsack and passed it to Jerry. &ldquo;Be careful
you don&rsquo;t break your teeth when you bite into
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, pal.&rdquo; Jerry filled two aluminum canteen
cups from the coffee thermos and sipped
from one. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lukewarm, anyway,&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;We can heat the
cups on the stove and sit the sandwiches on top of
the cup. That way the steam will thaw out the
bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brilliant. If it wasn&rsquo;t so cold, I&rsquo;d take my hat
off to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, they were munching hungrily
on a relatively decent meal. Jerry inhaled
the steam that was rising from his canteen cup and
sighed contentedly. &ldquo;I know it must be my imagination,
but right now I&rsquo;d say this is the best-tasting
chow I ever ate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy laughed and nodded. &ldquo;We used to say the
same thing about the mickeys we roasted in the
corner lot when we were kids. All black with ashes
and dirt, but boy, they sure did taste good.&rdquo; He
lowered the wick a little on the stove. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably
the hot coffee, but I&rsquo;m beginning to get
warm in here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with being warm?&rdquo; Jerry protested.
&ldquo;Turn it up as high as it will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy frowned. &ldquo;When you live in frigid temperatures
it&rsquo;s safer to feel a little cold than it is
to be overheated, because when you cool off, the
perspiration will turn to ice on your skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perspiration!&rdquo; Jerry gawked incredulously.
&ldquo;Are you kidding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not going to take any chances. As
soon as we&rsquo;re finished eating, I&rsquo;m going to turn
off the stove altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until I&rsquo;m snug in my bedroll,&rdquo; Jerry
begged.</p>
<p>Sandy looked worried. &ldquo;Poor Charley. He&rsquo;s not
going to be very snug tonight. No bedroll, no
food. Gee, I wish I knew what happened to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes it worse,&rdquo; Jerry said gloomily, &ldquo;is
that it&rsquo;s our fault. If we hadn&rsquo;t dragged so far behind,
he wouldn&rsquo;t have had to go looking for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys finished their sandwiches and coffee
in subdued silence, staring out into the stormy
night through the diminishing black hole of the
entranceway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Sandy said suddenly, &ldquo;in another
hour we&rsquo;ll be snowed in tight inside this lean-to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Jerry surveyed the drifting snow anxiously.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Like a tomb. We&rsquo;ll be able to get
out, though, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy reached over and enlarged the opening
with one hand. &ldquo;Oh, yes. It&rsquo;s as light as powder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had finished eating and wrapped up
the garbage, they prepared to bed down for the
night. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better do this one at a time,&rdquo; Sandy
suggested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d only be in each other&rsquo;s way moving
around in here together. I&rsquo;ll go outside until
you&rsquo;re all settled. You lie with your head up at
the front of the sled. I&rsquo;ll lie the opposite way.
That way we&rsquo;ll have more room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crawling on hands and knees, Sandy pushed
through the drift that was blocking up the opening.
A furious blast of bitter cold wind took his
breath away as he got to his feet and sent him reeling
back from the sled. It was even warmer inside
the lean-to than he had realized. He recalled that
Tagish Charley had a powerful flashlight in his
gear and walked through knee-high snow to the
front of the sled to look for it. It would be wise to
keep it handy in the lean-to, he decided. He
found the light easily and turned it on to see how
the dogs were making out. They were all huddled
together behind the windbreak of the sled, growling
and shifting around restlessly. As the flash
beam swept over them, a few cringed and bared
their fangs. Their behavior distressed Sandy, who
had expected that by now they would all be cozily
balled up in holes and snoring peacefully. He
skirted around them and walked back to consult
with Jerry. Beaming the light on the lean-to, he
saw that the snow was mounding it over like an
igloo. Once more he had to dig the snow away
from the entrance before he could get in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>When he crawled inside, he saw that Jerry was
stretched out in his sleeping bag, the hooded
cover zipped up tightly around his head. Only his
eyes, nose and mouth were showing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the weather outside?&rdquo; he asked Sandy.</p>
<p>Sandy shook the snow off his hood. &ldquo;Same as before.
Terrible. The dogs are acting up, too. I&rsquo;m
worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. They act frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too. We&rsquo;re snowbound in the Yukon.
Charley&rsquo;s missing, probably frozen to death in a
snowdrift. Our food is about gone. What a mess!
I&rsquo;m scared plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment a long, mournful animal howl
rose clearly above the intensity of the wind. Before
it trailed off, another howl and still another
joined it, forming an eerie chorus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Jerry snapped upright like a jack-in-the-box, his
face drained of blood. &ldquo;Wolves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And close by,&rdquo; Sandy said grimly.</p>
<p>Outside, the dogs were really setting up an uproar
now, snarling and barking frantically.</p>
<p>Despite the seriousness of the situation, Sandy
had to smile as he watched his friend struggling to
get out of the sleeping bag. In his excitement,
Jerry couldn&rsquo;t work the zipper. &ldquo;Get me out of
this strait jacket!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;In that bag you
look like a big fat hot dog with a face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so loud,&rdquo; Jerry cautioned him. &ldquo;The
wolves might hear you. Just hurry and get me out
of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between them they finally got the sleeping bag
unzipped, and Jerry rolled out. Sandy took the
Army .45 out of his pocket and checked the clip.
There were still four shells in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have any more ammunition for that
cannon?&rdquo; Jerry asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably up front in Charley&rsquo;s gear. I&rsquo;m going
up to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with you,&rdquo; Jerry said promptly.
&ldquo;One of those wolves might poke his snout in here
while you&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>They scrambled out into the blizzard and stood
up. Sandy switched on the flashlight and swept it
in a wide circle about them. The powerful beam
seemed to run into a solid wall of white no more
than fifty feet away. He turned it on the dogs,
who were setting up such a loud racket that it
drowned out the howling of the wolves. The huskies
were all on their feet now, standing stiff-legged
with their tails curled tightly beneath their bellies.
Their lips were drawn back over their teeth,
and the thick fur around their necks bristled like
porcupine quills. Sandy swung the light in the direction
of their gaze, and felt his heart flip and
miss a beat. Glowing greenishly through the falling
flakes was a circle of eyes. They were there for
just an instant and then faded back out of range
of the beam.</p>
<p>Jerry gripped Sandy&rsquo;s arm tightly. &ldquo;There
must be a whole pack of &rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re just waiting
for us to fall asleep and then they&rsquo;ll jump us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the huskies began to slink forward toward
the wolves, his belly flattened close to the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back here, boy!&rdquo; Sandy shouted.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll tear him to pieces,&rdquo; he muttered to
Jerry. He cocked the automatic and aimed in the
direction of the glowing eyes. &ldquo;I hate to waste
ammo like this, but maybe we can scare them off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>He fired three shots. The last shot was answered
by a sharp yelp of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got one!&rdquo; Jerry yelled excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh! Listen!&rdquo; Sandy said. Above the wailing
of the storm they could hear wild snarling and
yelping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like they&rsquo;re fighting among themselves,&rdquo;
Jerry said.</p>
<p>The commotion ended as abruptly as it had begun,
and although Sandy kept searching the darkness
with the light for a long time, there was no
further sign of the wolves. At last, when the dogs
quieted down and curled up in burrows, the boys
relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the shots did scare them off at that,&rdquo;
Sandy decided. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s find that box of ammo
in Charley&rsquo;s pack, and then we can go back inside
and see if we can get some rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep?&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;Are you kidding? Suppose
they come back again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dogs will warn us if they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry shivered. &ldquo;Okay. But I&rsquo;ll take the bed
next to the wall, just in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The snow had completely blocked the entrance,
and they had to shovel energetically to
clear it. &ldquo;Man, it&rsquo;s really warm in here,&rdquo; Jerry
said as he crawled into the lean-to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The snow wall that had built up at the other
end of the lean-to and on the sled side was smooth
and glistening. &ldquo;Just like an igloo,&rdquo; Sandy said.
As soon as they were inside their sleeping bags,
he turned off the Coleman stove.</p>
<p>Jerry sighed as the little hut was plunged into
pitch-darkness. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know better, I&rsquo;d think
I was back in my little trundle bed in Valley
View.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to sleep,&rdquo; Sandy grunted. He was facing the
entrance and the automatic was within easy reach
in his side pocket. In an emergency, he knew he
could fire right through the sleeping bag.</p>
<p>Gradually, his eyes became accustomed to the
darkness and he could make out the faint outline
of the round doorway. His eyelids grew heavier
and the hole grew smaller and smaller. Then he
dropped off to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER NINE</span>
<br />Trapped in an Icy Tomb</h2>
<p>When Sandy awoke, it was still pitch-dark inside
the lean-to. He was about to roll over and go back
to sleep, but he decided to see what time it was
first. He pulled down the zipper of his sleeping
bag, fumbled for the flashlight and flicked the
switch.</p>
<p>The sudden burst of light woke up Jerry.
&ldquo;Whazza matter?&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to sleep,&rdquo; Sandy told him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still
the middle of the night.&rdquo; He turned the spot on
his wrist watch. &ldquo;What the&mdash;&rdquo; he exclaimed, and
sat up, startled. He squinted at the dial again, but
there was no mistake. It said 7:30. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible!
It must have stopped!&rdquo; But he held it up
to his ear and heard the steady, rhythmic ticking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; Jerry, fully
awake now, propped himself up on one elbow.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Sandy began to laugh. &ldquo;Oh, I get it.
We&rsquo;re snowed in.&rdquo; He explained to Jerry. &ldquo;My
watch said it was half past seven, but I couldn&rsquo;t believe
it because it was so dark in here. It&rsquo;s the
snow; it&rsquo;s blocking out the daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really morning?&rdquo; Jerry said doubtfully.
&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go out and find out.&rdquo; He unzippered
his sleeping bag.</p>
<p>Propping the torch up in the snow, Sandy tried
to push his head and shoulders through the drift
that blocked the entrance. It was like running into
a stone wall. &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; he cried. He dug at the
snow with his fingers, but his mittens slid futilely
off a surface that was as smooth as a skating rink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come on,&rdquo; Jerry said impatiently. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Door&rsquo;s frozen up,&rdquo; Sandy told him. He sat
down and tried to kick through the ice with his
feet, but couldn&rsquo;t dent it. He turned to Jerry.
&ldquo;Try your end. This one is plugged up solid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;So is this end,&rdquo; Jerry reported, after pounding
away with his hands and feet for several minutes.
&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;ll go out the side.&rdquo; He grabbed one corner
of the robe and tugged it loose from where
it was anchored under the snow, while Sandy
worked on the other corner. Then they pulled it
aside, exposing a smooth, glittering expanse of ice
behind it.</p>
<p>Sandy tested it with his fist and whistled. &ldquo;Like
iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tremor in Jerry&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;What
goes on around here? Maybe I wasn&rsquo;t kidding last
night when I called this thing a tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; Sandy soothed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, ice,&rdquo; Jerry repeated. &ldquo;You ever see
them drive trucks across the ice on frozen lakes?
I&rsquo;ve seen it in newsreels. That ice is pretty rugged
stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got a knife?&rdquo; Sandy asked. &ldquo;I left mine in
the sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I. Say, let&rsquo;s try to move the sled,&rdquo;
Jerry suggested.</p>
<p>They both shoved and pulled at the sled for a
long time, but it seemed welded to the spot. At
last, Jerry sank down exhausted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.
What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Sandy played the light over the walls of the
lean-to. &ldquo;I can guess. Remember how cozy and
warm it got in here last night? Between that stove
and the heat from our bodies, I bet the temperature
in here was a good fifty degrees higher than it
was outside. The heat radiates through the snow,
causing it to melt partially. Then it freezes up.
That&rsquo;s how the Eskimos harden the walls of their
snow houses. They build big bonfires in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only they don&rsquo;t forget to make doors in &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
Jerry said grimly. &ldquo;Another thousand years from
now, I can see a couple of geologists like your dad
and the professor digging us out. Preserved in a
block of ice like that baby mammoth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joking matter,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got to think of a way to break out of here. One
thing, though: they&rsquo;re bound to send out search
parties and sooner or later they&rsquo;ll find the sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; Jerry demanded.
&ldquo;The sled is probably covered with snow by now
and this must look like any other part of the landscape.
And you don&rsquo;t think those dogs are going to
hang around here forever, do you? They&rsquo;ve probably
run off looking for food already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy felt his heart begin to race madly. &ldquo;I
never thought of that,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s
up to us then. What have we got that we can use
as a chipping tool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only thing I can think of that&rsquo;s metal is the
Coleman stove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no good. No sharp edges.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>They were silent for a moment, then Sandy
snapped his fingers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it! The gun!&rdquo; He
took the bulky .45 out of his pocket and held it up
in the light. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll blast our way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry looked worried. &ldquo;You know what they
say about shooting fish in a rain barrel? Well, if
one of those slugs ever ricochets inside here, we&rsquo;ll
be dead fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only chance,&rdquo; Sandy said. He loaded
the gun, cocked the hammer and nudged off the
safety with his thumb. Holding the gun at arm&rsquo;s
length away from him, he pointed the muzzle at
the end where the entrance had been. &ldquo;Better
make sure your hood is pulled tight over your
ears,&rdquo; he advised Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all set. Let &rsquo;er go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy shut his eyes and tightened his finger on
the trigger. The explosion reverberated like a
bomb in the small lean-to. Sandy felt the shock
wave slam into his face, and the recoil almost tore
the gun out of his hand. He sat there stunned for
a while.</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s voice screaming in his ear brought
him out of it. &ldquo;Sandy, it worked!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>He opened his eyes to the most wonderful sight
he had ever seen. A beam of sunlight was pouring
through an opening in the ice wall. The potent,
snub-nosed .45 slug had blasted a hole almost four
inches in diameter. In the light of the flashlight,
he also observed that the ice around the hole was
shattered and veined from the shock wave.</p>
<p>Dropping the gun back into his pocket, Sandy
got on his knees and began to work on the opening
with his hands. Snow and ice crumbled easily,
and before long he had enlarged the hole so that
he was able to squirm through. Jerry was right behind
him. Painfully, they stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Jerry groaned. &ldquo;I feel like a dog on its
hind legs.&rdquo; Looking up at the clear blue sky, he
threw kisses into the air with both hands. &ldquo;Mr.
Sun, I never figured we&rsquo;d ever see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a perfect, cloudless day without even a
breeze. Looking around him, Sandy realized that
the high winds of the night before had exaggerated
the intensity of the blizzard. Except where it
had drifted around the sled and lean-to, no more
than twelve inches of new snow had fallen. He
discovered, too, that they had been traveling
along the ridge of a low hill and had stopped on
the most exposed spot in all the surrounding terrain.
On either side, the ground sloped away
gently into protected valleys thick with fir trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>After spending hours shut up in the gloom of
the lean-to, the boys found the sunlight on the
snow blinding. They dug their smoked glasses out
of their packs and put them on. The dogs crowded
around them, yelping and wagging their tails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;re hungry,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;Is there
any meat left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Jerry said. He went to get the can of
food from the front of the sled. As he threw the
last chunks of raw horse meat to the huskies, he
eyed it forlornly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hungry I could eat it
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned. &ldquo;Even some of that <i>muk-tuk</i>
would look good to me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the sandwiches all gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We finished them last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had just finished feeding the dogs when
a faint &ldquo;Ha-lo-oo-oo...&rdquo; floated through the
still air. On a distant ridge the figure of a man and
a dog were silhouetted against the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Charley and Titan!&rdquo; the boys yelled in
unison. They began to leap up and down, waving
their arms and screaming, &ldquo;Charley! Over here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Less than a quarter of an hour later, the Indian
came plowing up the hill with Black Titan floundering
behind him. They hugged him joyfully
and pounded his back, and even Charley was grinning
from ear to ear. He listened solemnly while
they related their harrowing experiences with the
wolves and how they had been trapped in the lean-to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Charley had had a pretty bad time of it himself.
He admitted that, for the first time in his life, he
had lost his way when he went back to look for
the boys, and had somehow mistaken east for west.
Confused and blinded by the shifting gale winds
and whipping snow, he had wandered off to an
adjacent ridge. After walking around for hours,
he had become exhausted&mdash;he had been tired out
by running twenty-five miles behind the sled to
start with&mdash;and erected a lean-to in a clump of
thick pine trees in the sheltered valley. He had
built a big fire and had fallen asleep beside it almost
immediately. The next thing he knew, Black
Titan was licking his face and the first streaks of
dawn were filtering through the pine branches
overhead. He had been searching for the boys
when he heard the gunshot.</p>
<p>Using the snowshoes as shovels, the three of
them dug the sled out of the snow bank. The
intense heat of the sun softened the hard upper
crust and melted the ice that had formed around
the runners. Then Charley hitched up the dogs
and headed for the nearest check point, which
was only a few miles away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Their arrival created quite a bit of excitement.
&ldquo;Only one other sled has come through here,&rdquo;
a worried official told them. &ldquo;The Mounties have
planes and search parties out looking for the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw one of the planes,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;He
dipped his wings and we waved to him. So he
knew we were all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, though,&rdquo; the official went on, &ldquo;the
storm looked worse last night than it was. Those
winds were gale force. I don&rsquo;t imagine anyone
was really in serious trouble. They&rsquo;re all experienced
woodsmen, accustomed to roughing it on
the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry hooked his thumbs inside his belt and
puffed out his chest. &ldquo;Sure, it was a breeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tagish Charley was more interested in the sled
that had passed through the check point that
morning. The official said the other driver had
about one hour&rsquo;s start on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We catch &rsquo;im,&rdquo; Charley said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Jerry complained. &ldquo;What about breakfast?
I&rsquo;m so ravenous, I&rsquo;m liable to take a bite out
of one of the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time to eat,&rdquo; the Indian said. &ldquo;We have to
win race.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give you some sandwiches and hot coffee
to take along,&rdquo; the official promised. &ldquo;You can eat
on the run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry stared wistfully at the platters of flapjacks,
juicy Canadian bacon and hot biscuits on
the stove. &ldquo;If we come out of this alive, I&rsquo;ll never
look at a cold sandwich again,&rdquo; he vowed.</p>
<p>A short time later, they were racing down the
trail. It was a good day, and by nightfall they had
covered another forty-five miles and overtaken
the sled ahead of them. Its driver turned out to be
a young uranium prospector. For five years he and
his brother had been competing in the big race.
Two years before, they had come in first and they
were hoping to repeat this year. They were pleasant
young men and spent the night with Charley
and the boys at the last check point on the route.</p>
<p>That night, after a hearty supper, they sat
around the fire talking to Sandy and Jerry.
Tagish Charley went to bed as soon as he had the
team fed and settled in the barn. About nine
o&rsquo;clock, another sled arrived at the check point,
and the driver reported that still another team
was camped at the side of the trail about an hour&rsquo;s
ride away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is really going to be a photo finish,&rdquo; one
of the brothers said. He got to his feet and
knocked the ash out of his pipe into the fireplace.
&ldquo;We better sack in, men. There&rsquo;s going to be a
mad scramble to get away first in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Jerry followed them to the big dormitory
bedroom, where a dozen army cots were
set up around a potbellied stove that glowed a
dull cherry-red in the darkness. Charley was already
snoring loudly as they slipped into their
bedrolls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now how are we supposed to get to sleep with
that big lug sawing wood?&rdquo; Jerry grumbled.
&ldquo;We may as well sit and ... and ... talk ...
around ... the ... fire....&rdquo; His voice trailed
off into a pretty good imitation of a buzz saw of
its own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER TEN</span>
<br />Down the Chilkoot Chute to Victory</h2>
<p>It seemed to Sandy that he had just closed his
eyes when he felt rough hands on his shoulders,
shaking him. &ldquo;Time to go,&rdquo; Charley&rsquo;s voice whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; he mumbled, raising himself
on his elbows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Charley said. &ldquo;Other fellers
hitching up already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Sandy struggled out of his sleeping bag and sat
on the edge of the cot, stretching. It was still dark,
but when Charley opened the stove door to throw
on another log, he could see that the cots that the
two brothers had slept on were empty. Yawning,
he raised his left foot and kicked the cot where
Jerry was still sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise and shine!&rdquo; he called to his friend.</p>
<p>They ate a hurried breakfast of hot cereal
and scalding coffee, and by four-thirty they were
on the trail again. The cold wind in their faces
and the stinging spray kicked up by the dogs&rsquo; feet
brought them fully awake before they had gone
far.</p>
<p>When it began to get light, the boys got out of
the sled and trotted along with Charley. They
kept it up for a mile or so before Jerry developed
a bad case of rubber legs and went down on his
knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like a dope,&rdquo; he said, as Sandy helped
him back into the sled. &ldquo;Here we are, a couple of
kids, puffing like steam engines, and an old guy
like Charley isn&rsquo;t breathing any harder than if he
had run up a flight of stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re in pretty good condition from being
in school athletics. Can you imagine how
some of the other guys in school would make
out?&rdquo; Sandy asked. &ldquo;The guys who hop in the
family car to go down to the corner newsstand and
sneak smokes between every class?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jerry agreed ruefully. &ldquo;The kids in the
States are getting soft, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;My Uncle Russ always says you should take at
least as much pride in your body as you do in your
home. Most people wouldn&rsquo;t live in sloppy, rundown
houses, but a lot of them don&rsquo;t care if they
spend their lives in sloppy, rundown bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry slapped his middle irritably. &ldquo;Let me tell
you, I&rsquo;m going to work on this flab when I get
home. Old Charley here has taught me a lesson.
You miss a lot of the fun of life if you&rsquo;re out of
shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy kept up with Charley for another mile,
then he got back into the sled. He noticed that the
Indian held to a pattern: he would run along for a
half hour or so and then hitch a ride on the sled
for ten minutes. It seemed as if he could go on like
that endlessly and tirelessly.</p>
<p>They stopped at mid-morning to give the dogs a
rest and brew some strong Indian tea. Charley
wouldn&rsquo;t drink the coffee in the thermos. &ldquo;Coffee
no good. You ever see huskies drink coffee?&rdquo; The
boys had to admit that they never had. &ldquo;Indian
tea like medicine. Make you strong and healthy.
Dogs know.&rdquo; To demonstrate, he poured a little
into a tin plate for Titan, and the big lead dog
lapped it up promptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sure doesn&rsquo;t look as if we&rsquo;re ever going to
catch those guys ahead of us, Charley,&rdquo; Sandy commented,
dropping a handful of snow into his cup
to cool it.</p>
<p>Charley looked down the trail behind them.
&ldquo;They behind us now. Last hill we pass, we go
around the long way, maybe mile longer. They go
through valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry blinked. &ldquo;If we came the long way, how
come we&rsquo;re ahead of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian shrugged. &ldquo;That valley like pocket
after big snow. Drifts three, four feet deep. They
have plenty trouble getting through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned. &ldquo;What a sly old fox you are,
Charley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were traveling high in the coastal mountains
of British Columbia now, moving through
the Chilkoot Pass. Just before noon, they arrived
at a customs check point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the first team through,&rdquo; the mounted
policeman who waved them past shouted.</p>
<p>Abruptly, the trail appeared to end at the edge
of a cliff. Charley reined the team in and motioned
for the boys to step to the rim of the drop-off.
Here they saw that, in reality, the trail continued
on down a steep incline that resembled the
big drop on a roller coaster. For almost 1,200 feet
it fell away at a 45-degree angle into the coastal
valley below. It was a magnificent spectacle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Jerry gulped hard. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going down <i>that</i>
in a sled, are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tagish Charley nodded curtly. &ldquo;Chilkoot
Chute. We take dogs off first. They follow us
down.&rdquo; He walked back and began to remove
Black Titan&rsquo;s harness.</p>
<p>Sandy grinned at Jerry. &ldquo;You ever been on a
bobsled?&rdquo; Jerry shook his head mutely. &ldquo;Well,
after this it&rsquo;ll be a cinch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the dogs were unhitched, the boys
climbed aboard the sled, and Charley pushed it
to the edge of the chute. It teetered briefly, then
nosed down the incline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alaska next stop!&rdquo; Sandy yelled as they picked
up speed. A rush of air choked the words off in
his mouth, and his stomach rose up in his rib
cage with a sickening sensation that was ten times
worse than he had ever experienced in an elevator.</p>
<p>Faster and faster the sled shot down the slope,
swaying from side to side, as Charley, riding the
tail, shifted his weight skillfully to steer it. Behind
it the dogs skidded and scrambled down the
chute, barking and yelping excitedly. The sled
reached the bottom and glided down the trail almost
half a mile before it came to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a ride!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must have skidded halfway to Skagway,&rdquo;
Sandy said. He got out of the sled and looked back
at the Chilkoot Chute. &ldquo;Gee, it doesn&rsquo;t look so
bad from here, but when you&rsquo;re on it, you&rsquo;d swear
it was a perpendicular wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dogs finally caught up and Charley hitched
them to the sled again. &ldquo;We win now easy,&rdquo; he
said matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>As they approached Skagway, they passed cabins,
farms and other signs of civilization. A group
of children playing in one yard gave them a lusty
cheer and chased after the sled. Farther along,
other children tagged on to the caravan along
with three dogs.</p>
<p>Then, up ahead on the outskirts of the city,
they saw a big crowd of people. &ldquo;Finish line,&rdquo;
Charley informed them.</p>
<p>When the sled came into view, a tremendous
roar went up and continued unabated as they shot
past a man waving a flag. The next thing Sandy
knew, they were engulfed by a sea of well-wishers,
and men were pounding him on the back so enthusiastically
that it took his breath away. At last
he spied his father and Professor Crowell fighting
their way through the throng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; he called out happily. &ldquo;We made it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Dr. Steele reached the boys and threw an arm
around each of them. &ldquo;Congratulations! This
was quite a race, I hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charley is the guy who rates the congratulations,&rdquo;
Sandy answered.</p>
<p>Professor Crowell pounded Tagish Charley on
the back ecstatically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the proudest and happiest
man in the world. I haven&rsquo;t felt like this
since my twin girls were born. Thank you,
Charley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley knelt down and put his arms around
Black Titan, who was accepting praise and pats
from all quarters with the dignified reserve of a
true champion. &ldquo;Dogs win the race. Charley just
come along for ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, back at the hotel, after a warm bath and
a good supper, the boys recounted the adventures
they had had during the race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul,&rdquo; Professor Crowell said to
Jerry, &ldquo;now you really have an idea of the rigorous
life that the sourdoughs led. Does it still
sound appealing to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry forked the last piece of homemade apple
pie from his plate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion
that I&rsquo;m just a city boy at heart, sir,&rdquo; he declared
emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was your visit to Fairbanks?&rdquo; Sandy asked
his father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;We had a fine time,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said. &ldquo;I gathered
some priceless material for the pamphlet
I&rsquo;m preparing on the Pleistocene Era.&rdquo; He
smiled. &ldquo;But promise you won&rsquo;t tell Quiz Taylor,
Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy laughed. &ldquo;I know what you mean, Dad.
My solemn word, I won&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on the agenda now, Dr. Steele?&rdquo; Jerry
inquired. &ldquo;Are we going home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for another few days, Jerry,&rdquo; Dr. Steele
said. &ldquo;The professor and I want to fly up to Valdez
and look over some old mining sites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Valdez?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most northerly ice-free port in Alaska. It
used to be the shipping point for copper ore until
the Kennecott mines closed down in 1938. We
had planned an exciting outing for you fellows&mdash;&rdquo;
he hesitated and looked wryly at Jerry&mdash;&ldquo;but inasmuch
as Jerry says he&rsquo;s a city boy at heart, well,
maybe we&rsquo;d better forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of an outing, Dad?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Dr. Steele lit his pipe and blew a cloud of
smoke at the ceiling. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be using the
plane for several days, and we thought you might
like to visit Kodiak Island. One of the instructors
from the university will be spending a week
there, hunting bear, and he said you boys would
be welcome to join him.&rdquo; He winked at Sandy.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not sure your city friend here would be
up to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;Jerry can stay
here at the hotel until we come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; Jerry snorted. &ldquo;I want to
take one of those bearskins back to my mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tagish Charley looked up from his plate solemnly.
&ldquo;Kodiak bear plenty bad killer. Maybe he
take your skin back to his mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone except Charley laughed.</p>
<p class="tb">The next morning they boarded the big Norseman
plane and headed northwest up the coast for
Valdez. As they flew over the glacier-ribbed
mountains, the boys were awed by the wild
beauty of the country beneath them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so primitive,&rdquo; Sandy remarked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think man will ever tame it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he will,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said. &ldquo;As surely as
he tamed the American West. We just didn&rsquo;t pay
much attention to it until after World War Two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A land of untold riches,&rdquo; Lou Mayer mused.
&ldquo;Gold, copper, silver, coal, lead, tin, mercury,
platinum&mdash;Lord knows what else.&rdquo; He looked
over meaningfully at Dr. Steele.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Things are certainly moving fast,&rdquo; Dr. Steele
went on, a little too quickly, Sandy thought. &ldquo;Oh,
yes, Son, in another fifty years Alaska will be as
civilized as California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not nearly so warm,&rdquo; Lou Mayer added.</p>
<p>Professor Crowell smiled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I like
our northern winters. They make for greater intimacy
among families and friends. When the temperature
is fifty below zero and the snow is piled
up to your window sills, there is literally no place
like home. You discover that being together in
front of a warm fireplace can be just as enjoyable
as running off to the theater, bridge clubs, night
clubs, bowling alleys and all your so-called civilized
diversions. The trouble with so many young
people these days is that they try too hard to have
fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry scratched his head thoughtfully. &ldquo;Professor,
you know, you&rsquo;re right. I can&rsquo;t think of
any time in my life when I&rsquo;ve had more fun than
I did the Christmas Eve we spent at that little
weather station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele took out a small wallet calendar and
consulted it. &ldquo;Which reminds me that tonight is
New Year&rsquo;s Eve.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it funny how you keep forgetting about
the holidays up here?&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;I guess they
see the old year out pretty quietly. Not like the
States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Crowell&rsquo;s eyes twinkled through his
glasses. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bet on it, son. Some of the New
Year&rsquo;s parties I&rsquo;ve been to in the North make
your Stateside celebrations seem like pink teas. In
the old days, I remember some shindigs that went
on continuously from Christmas right through
New Year&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He smiled nostalgically. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised if a few of them were still going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll be spending our New Year&rsquo;s on Kodiak,&rdquo;
Jerry reminded them. &ldquo;I was looking at it
on the map. It&rsquo;s just a dinky little island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so dinky,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about a
hundred miles long, you know. And I think you&rsquo;ll
find that its citizens have just as much holiday
spirit as the people in the States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do many people live on Kodiak?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too heavily populated,&rdquo; Dr. Steele admitted.
&ldquo;Once it was the center of the Alaskan
fur trade. The Russians settled in the town of Kodiak
in 1784, and it wasn&rsquo;t until much later that
they moved their headquarters to the mainland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nowadays it&rsquo;s hard to make a living on Kodiak.
I think the only major occupation is salmon
fishing. There&rsquo;s rich farming land at the south end
of the island, but the natives have always had difficulty
raising sheep and cattle. Too many hungry
bears around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry squinted down the barrel of an imaginary
rifle. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;ll be a few less after we get
there, eh, Sandy boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tagish Charley, who had been staring moodily
out of the window, turned his quizzical black eyes
on Jerry. &ldquo;You shoot big as you talk, everything
be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you better go along and take care of
these fellows, Charley,&rdquo; the professor suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be great,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;How
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley appeared to consider the proposition
for a moment, then looked gravely at Sandy
from beneath his black eyebrows. &ldquo;Charley like
to go to Kodiak. But better not. I stay and look
out for professor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER ELEVEN</span>
<br />Off to Hunt Kodiak Bears</h2>
<p>At quarter after twelve the Norseman put
down on the outskirts of Cordova, and the three
geologists disembarked along with Tagish Charley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be in Kodiak before dark,&rdquo; Dr. Steele
told the boys before he left them. &ldquo;The pilot will
radio ahead so Professor Stern can be on hand to
meet you when you land. Be sure and bring us
back a bearskin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; Sandy promised. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll see you
back here on the third of January.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Doctor,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;And Happy
New Year.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jerry, and the same to you.&rdquo; Dr.
Steele winked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat too much <i>muk-tuk</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the plane was refueled, they took off
again. When Jerry began to nod drowsily, Sandy
went up front and sat down in the copilot&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>Russell Parker, the pilot, was a chunky, gray-haired
man in his late forties, a veteran of the
World War II Air Corps. &ldquo;I was stationed in the
Aleutians for four years,&rdquo; he told Sandy. &ldquo;The
place sort of grew on me. There was this girl in
Anchorage, too. Well, as soon as the war was over
we were married, and I decided to settle here permanently.
I had no family ties back in the States,
so the transition was easy.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;You
might say I found a home here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been a bush pilot ever since?&rdquo;
Sandy said. &ldquo;Boy, that must be an exciting life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it exciting exactly. A little
romantic maybe&mdash;everything about <i>Alashka</i> is
romantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Alashka?</i>&rdquo; Sandy looked puzzled. &ldquo;I notice you
always say it that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ancient Aleutian term. Means the &lsquo;big
land.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s big all right,&rdquo; Sandy said, glancing out of
the cockpit window. Below the plane, twin mountain
peaks reached up through the wispy clouds.
Cupped in the valley between them lay a gigantic
glacier whose front was a solid wall of ice ten
miles across and as high as a fifteen-story building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why there are plenty of jobs for bush
pilots,&rdquo; Parker explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re like taxi drivers
back in the States. To get around in the big
land you have to take giant steps. A quick trip to
the city may mean a hop of a hundred miles or
more. You should see Lake Hood on a Saturday
morning in the summer&mdash;that&rsquo;s in Anchorage, my
home town. Hundreds of little planes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a supermarket parking lot,&rdquo;
Sandy finished the thought for him. &ldquo;Professor
Crowell told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse. More like Times Square in New
York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But since so many people up here have their
own planes, doesn&rsquo;t it cut down on your jobs?&rdquo;
Sandy wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really. Most of the amateurs are pretty
cautious, as they should be. They&rsquo;ll only fly in
perfect weather, and stick to the safe air routes.
When there&rsquo;s a tough job to be done in a hurry,
they call on a bush pilot. I&rsquo;ve carried everything
from heavy machinery to medical supplies. I&rsquo;ve
been a flying ambulance, too; I don&rsquo;t know how
many lives I&rsquo;ve helped to save in the back country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you often get assignments like this one?&rdquo;
Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve flown my share of VIPs, but mostly it&rsquo;s a
job for military pilots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You consider my dad and Professor Crowell
VIPs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got that impression,&rdquo; Parker said guardedly.
He was about to add something else when a burst
of static from the radio diverted his attention.
&ldquo;Tower at Anchorage calling us,&rdquo; he told Sandy,
adjusting his earphones. He listened, then flipped
the switch over to transmit. &ldquo;N-140 to Anchorage
... Read you clear ... Climbing to 12,000
feet ... Over and out.&rdquo; He flipped the switch
and reported to Sandy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re climbing another
4,000 feet. We&rsquo;re heading into a snow squall off
Kodiak, moving northeast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry awoke from his nap and came up front to
join them. &ldquo;You guys hungry? I&rsquo;m going to break
out the sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy laughed. &ldquo;Is eating all you ever think
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry flicked Sandy&rsquo;s cowlick with one finger.
&ldquo;Especially when I ride in airplanes. I have to
keep my stomach weighted down so it won&rsquo;t do
flip-flops.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll join you,&rdquo; Sandy agreed. &ldquo;How
about you, Mr. Parker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait awhile,&rdquo; the pilot declined. &ldquo;Soon as
we level off at 12,000, I&rsquo;ll set her on automatic
pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys walked back to their seats and opened
the lunchbox the hotel had prepared for them
that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking,&rdquo; Jerry said, chewing on a
chicken leg, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t seen anything of those
characters who took pot shots at us for a few days
now. Think they&rsquo;ve given up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s brow furrowed in anxiety. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know, Jerry. From what we know of them, they
don&rsquo;t seem to be the kind who give up so easily.
They&rsquo;ve been after the professor for months now.
Maybe we should have stayed with them back at
Cordova.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, what could happen to them in Cordova?
Those birds wouldn&rsquo;t try anything in the middle
of a big town like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy nibbled at his sandwich without relish.
&ldquo;I suppose not. But Dad and the professor are going
to be out poking around some old abandoned
mine sites.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The discussion ended when Parker called back,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready for that sandwich now. And a cup of
coffee if you don&rsquo;t mind. Black, no sugar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it up to him,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>It was still bright daylight in the air when they
sighted Kodiak, but the island and the sea around
it were shrouded in purple dusk. Lights began to
twinkle on below as they circled the city of Kodiak,
losing altitude. Towering prominently over
the other low buildings were a pair of onion-shaped
domes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Sandy asked Parker. &ldquo;They look
almost Turkish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Russian Orthodox church,&rdquo; the pilot
said. &ldquo;Remember, the Russians founded Kodiak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did those Russians ever get way over
here?&rdquo; Jerry wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, are you dumb!&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;On the west
side only a thin strip of water separates Alaska
from Russia. The Bering Strait is only about forty
miles wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker nodded. &ldquo;In the winter you can cross it
on a sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That thought seemed to sober Jerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Parker touched the Norseman down gently on
its skis and reversed the propeller to brake their
slide. As they climbed out of the plane, the figure
of a man emerged out of the glare of the landing
lights. Clad in fur trousers, fur hood and fur
parka, he looked like an Eskimo. But as he approached,
Sandy could make out a small clipped
mustache and rimless eyeglasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Kodiak,&rdquo; he greeted them. &ldquo;You
must be Dr. Steele&rsquo;s son.&rdquo; He held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Sandy smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Kenneth Stern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy performed introductions all around. It
turned out that Parker and the young university
teacher were friends. &ldquo;My wife took some courses
with Professor Stern,&rdquo; the pilot explained.</p>
<p>Stern clapped his fur mittens together. &ldquo;I have
my jeep parked over at the edge of the field. Let&rsquo;s
get back to the lodge. Dora&mdash;that&rsquo;s my wife&mdash;has
a big bear roast in the oven. I imagine you fellows
are pretty hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go ahead,&rdquo; Parker said. &ldquo;I want to make
sure they put my baby safely to bed. I&rsquo;ll hitch a
ride to your camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Russ,&rdquo; Stern said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hold supper
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he got to do?&rdquo; Jerry inquired as they
walked through the crunchy snow to the jeep,
which was almost hidden by the great cloud of
smoke that was pouring out of the exhaust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to make sure the crankcase gets
drained,&rdquo; Stern said. &ldquo;You really do have to treat
machinery as if it were a baby in cold like this.
That&rsquo;s why I left the jeep running. It could freeze
up in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they drove through the town of Kodiak, the
boys were fascinated by the atmosphere. The cultures
of three centuries and varied races were
blended startlingly but not offensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like being on a Hollywood sound stage
where the sets are all mixed up,&rdquo; Sandy said
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly, it reminds me of the Old West,&rdquo; Jerry
said. &ldquo;Dodge City. I almost expect to see Wyatt
Earp come striding down the middle of the street
with his hands on his six-guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Stern laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an apt description,
Jerry. This is the twentieth-century
American frontier in a sense. It&rsquo;s only fitting that
the characteristics of the frontier should predominate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hunting lodge was a sprawling two-story
log building about a mile outside of Kodiak, with
a wide porch running around it on three sides.
Lights blazed warmly from its windows as they
pulled in the drive and bumped along to a big
barn at the back of the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Four other teachers and myself own it jointly,&rdquo;
Stern explained. &ldquo;We bought it about ten years
ago as a summer place. The fact is, we&rsquo;ve been using
it just as much in the winter as a hunting
lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I understand you to say we were having
bear roast for supper, Professor?&rdquo; Jerry inquired
politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;re not squeamish about eating it, are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, no!&rdquo; Jerry assured him. &ldquo;After some of
the things I&rsquo;ve been eating since I came to Alaska,
bear sounds like steak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; Stern told him. &ldquo;You wait and
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you shoot the bear, sir?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t been out yet. This is a piece of
meat we&rsquo;ve had in the freezer since last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding. What do you
need a freezer for up here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong, young fellow. It
so happens that the old joke about selling ice-boxes
to Eskimos isn&rsquo;t such a joke any more. During
the war, the Army discovered it was a lot more
practical to keep food in freezers than it was to
stow it in a shed outside. You see, the temperature
drops to sixty and seventy below zero some
nights in this country. That&rsquo;s about forty to fifty
degrees lower than the coldest deep freeze. At that
temperature food takes hours to thaw out. In the
freezer, it keeps just right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry shook his head. &ldquo;Can you beat that! Next
thing you know, the Arabs on the Sahara desert
will be turning to steam heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed Stern along a path to the back
door of the lodge. Mrs. Stern, a young woman in
ski pants and sweater, was in the kitchen basting
the roast when they came in. &ldquo;Supper will be another
hour yet,&rdquo; she apologized. &ldquo;I hope you boys
can hold out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Stern said. &ldquo;Russ Parker will be
along later.&rdquo; He turned to the boys. &ldquo;Come on inside
and meet Chris Hanson and his wife. They&rsquo;ll
be spending a few days with us too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chris Hanson?&rdquo; Sandy repeated it thoughtfully.
&ldquo;There used to be an All-American tackle
by that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stern grinned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our boy. He&rsquo;s an athletic
coach at the university.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed. &ldquo;Chris was
the best.&rdquo; Self-importantly, he added, &ldquo;As a matter
of fact we have a lot in common. I expect to
make All-American tackle myself some day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Sandy smirked and dug his fist playfully into
Jerry&rsquo;s midsection. &ldquo;You get any fatter, you won&rsquo;t
be able to bend down to flip the ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Hanson was a brawny man who made
even a six-footer like Sandy Steele feel like a little
boy. He reminded Sandy of the paintings of fierce
Vikings he had seen in grade-school history books,
though his blond hair was a bit thin on top. His
wife was a small, thin woman who sat as close to
the fire as possible, despite the fact that she was
bundled up in sweaters. The Hansons were just
finishing a game of Scrabble when the boys arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Georgia girl, you know,&rdquo; Mrs. Hanson
said in a marked Southern accent. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t
believe I&rsquo;ll ever get used to this climate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a friend who would sympathize with
you,&rdquo; Sandy told her. &ldquo;Lou Mayer, my father&rsquo;s
assistant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris grinned devilishly. &ldquo;Oh sure, we met
Lou when your dad came up to Fairbanks. Took
him skiing once. I don&rsquo;t think he likes me very
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they waited for supper to be served, the
boys coaxed Chris to reminisce about some of his
big gridiron games. Hungry as they were, it was
an unwelcome interruption when Mrs. Stern announced:
&ldquo;Chow&rsquo;s on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>There were seven people at the table&mdash;including
Russ Parker, who arrived just as they were sitting
down&mdash;and among them they picked an
eight-pound sirloin bear steak clean.</p>
<p>Jerry swabbed his plate clean with a crust of
bread. &ldquo;That was delicious, Mrs. Stern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an understatement,&rdquo; Sandy said, &ldquo;considering
that you had three portions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I made a hog of myself,&rdquo; Jerry admitted.
&ldquo;But when I bag one of those big Kodiaks tomorrow,
you can fill up your freezer with steaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stern smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very thoughtful of
you, Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Hanson looked amused. &ldquo;You ever done
any hunting before, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m on the high-school rifle team back
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy winked at Chris. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the guy they&rsquo;re
talking about when they say, &lsquo;He couldn&rsquo;t hit the
side of a barn.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry reddened as everyone laughed, and glared
at Sandy. &ldquo;I suppose you think you&rsquo;re Davy Crockett?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously, though,&rdquo; Professor Stern interjected,
&ldquo;a bear hunt can be very dangerous. Some of
these brutes on Kodiak are virtually indestructible.
And when they&rsquo;re wounded&mdash;well, just watch
out. There&rsquo;s an old saying among hunters that
you&rsquo;ve got to kill a Kodiak with your first shot, or
you never will kill him. I&rsquo;ve heard men who have
stalked lions, tigers&mdash;all kinds of big game&mdash;concede
that a Kodiak is the most fearsome of all
beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On second thought,&rdquo; Jerry said gravely,
&ldquo;maybe I&rsquo;ll just stay back here and play Scrabble
with the ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After supper the boys cornered Chris Hanson
again and discussed football and other sports. At
ten o&rsquo;clock, Professor Stern drove Russ Parker
into town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the boys invited me to a party at the
airport,&rdquo; Russ explained. &ldquo;I hate to run away like
this, but my brother-in-law is going to be there. I
haven&rsquo;t seen him in a while. He&rsquo;s in the service,
stationed in the Aleutians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfectly all right,&rdquo; Mrs. Stern said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t fool us, Russ,&rdquo; Chris Hanson kidded
him. &ldquo;You just want to sneak out of that bear hunt
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker snorted. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to drag me
off after any bears. Not unless I can hunt them
from the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are we going back to Cordova, Mr.
Parker?&rdquo; Sandy asked him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;I figure you can have a couple of days of hunting.
The professor expects us back on the third of
January.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Stern asked the boys whether they
wanted to ride into town with him and see how
the Kodiakans celebrated the New Year, but they
declined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We heard they had some pretty wild times up
here,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;But the way I feel, the only
thing that would look good to me is a soft, warm
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by twelve o&rsquo;clock they were in bed. &ldquo;I
wonder what the gang is doing back in Valley
View,&rdquo; Jerry sighed as they lay in the dark listening
to the sound of foghorns in St. Paul&rsquo;s harbor
blending with church bells and firecrackers in
distant Kodiak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can bet they&rsquo;re not planning to go bear
hunting at six in the morning,&rdquo; Sandy answered
sleepily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER TWELVE</span>
<br />Treed by a Wounded Bear</h2>
<p>Professor Stern roused the boys at eight o&rsquo;clock
on New Year&rsquo;s morning. &ldquo;Put on two suits of long
woolen underwear and two pairs of socks,&rdquo; he instructed
them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably be out until
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dressed quickly and went downstairs to
the big kitchen, where Chris Hanson was cooking
breakfast. &ldquo;How&rsquo;ll you have your eggs, fellows?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunny side up,&rdquo; Sandy answered. &ldquo;Can we
help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. You can start the toast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Sandy took a handful of sliced bread out of the
bread box and began searching through the cupboards.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the toaster?&rdquo; he asked finally.</p>
<p>Chris smiled and pointed to the stove. &ldquo;Right
here. Just butter the bread lightly and spread the
slices out between the lids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time, Sandy became aware that
the cooking stove was the old-fashioned, cast iron,
wood-burning type; the kind you saw only in
Western movies in the United States. A long
tongue of flame and a shower of sparks shot up into
the air as Chris lifted one of the front lids and set
the teakettle over the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we first bought the place,&rdquo; Chris said,
&ldquo;we planned to install one of those newfangled
electric stoves in a year or two. But we got attached
to this old girl. We&rsquo;ve never regretted it
either. I don&rsquo;t know how many times the electric
power has conked out for days at a time. Anyway,
this cooks better than any gas or electric
stove I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>After they had eaten, they stacked the dishes in
the sink and went out to the garage. Chris Hanson
and Professor Stern were armed with .30-.30
Winchester rifles. Stern said their neighbor down
the road had promised to provide weapons for the
boys. They piled into the jeep, which had been
warming up for a half hour, and drove about two
miles into the foothills to the ranch of Vladimir
Thorsen, the son of a Russian-Swedish sourdough
who had struck it rich in the gold rush. Thorsen
was a short, rugged-looking man of fifty, with
jet-black hair and a Vandyke beard. His English
was precise, with just a trace of an accent. He welcomed
the boys heartily and insisted that the men
join him in a last cup of strong black coffee mixed
with brandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we will have to look far for our
bear,&rdquo; he announced grimly. &ldquo;Two nights ago, a
big brute came right into the barnyard and carried
off one of my lambs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Hanson whistled shrilly between his
teeth. &ldquo;He had his nerve, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cunning old monster,&rdquo; Thorsen said.
&ldquo;From the size of his footprints, I would estimate
he weighs about 1,400 pounds. He has toes missing
on his two forefeet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s evidently been in some battles,&rdquo; Stern
said. &ldquo;And won them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the men had finished their coffee, Thorsen
escorted them into his den. The walls were
covered with pistols and rifles and the mounted
heads of every kind of big game imaginable. The
rancher took down two big, unwieldy, ancient-looking
rifles and handed them to the boys. &ldquo;Here
are your weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Sandy and Jerry couldn&rsquo;t help but show their
disappointment. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very nice guns, sir.&rdquo;
Sandy made an effort to sound appreciative. &ldquo;But&mdash;what
are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look as if they were left over from the
Revolutionary War,&rdquo; Professor Stern said tartly.
&ldquo;What are you trying to pull on these kids, Thorsen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorsen stroked his pointed beard and cast a
reproving eye on the instructor. &ldquo;You are an
American teacher and you don&rsquo;t recognize this
magnificent rifle! It is a Sharpe&rsquo;s buffalo gun, the
same kind that your Buffalo Bill killed 1,800 buffalo
with. I&rsquo;m ashamed of you, Kenneth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only single-shot, too,&rdquo; Jerry observed critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a gun like that you only need one shot,&rdquo;
Thorsen said. &ldquo;You could drop an elephant with
one shot.&rdquo; He opened a drawer of his desk and
took out a handful of enormous cartridges. &ldquo;See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Hanson picked one up and hefted it in
his palm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small artillery shell.&rdquo; He grinned
at the boys. &ldquo;You want to trade? I&rsquo;d feel plenty
safe facing Mr. Bear with this cannon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jerry answered quickly. &ldquo;If it was good
enough for Buffalo Bill, it&rsquo;s good enough for me.&rdquo;
He picked up one of the long rifles and balanced
it on his shoulder. &ldquo;Hup-two-three-four....&rdquo; He
staggered around the room. &ldquo;Hey, doesn&rsquo;t a
weapons carrier come with this thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rancher smiled, showing two rows of
strong, white teeth. &ldquo;You are a very funny fellow,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Maybe the bear will die laughing....
Come, the horses are already saddled and waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s face clouded over. &ldquo;Horses?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we may have to go ten or fifteen miles
into the hills.&rdquo; He led them out of the den,
through the kitchen and out the back door.</p>
<p>The boys fell behind as they approached the
stables. &ldquo;Have you ever ridden a horse before?&rdquo;
Jerry whispered to Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m a fair rider.&rdquo; Realization suddenly
dawned in his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve ridden before&mdash;haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only on the merry-go-round,&rdquo; Jerry said miserably.
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t say anything. I don&rsquo;t want to
spoil the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well ...&rdquo; Sandy was uncertain. &ldquo;I suppose
we&rsquo;ll be walking the horses mostly, so you can&rsquo;t
get into too much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we can hang back and you can instruct
me in the fine points of horsemanship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>An Indian groom brought the horses out of the
stable. They were much sturdier animals than the
ones Sandy had rented at any riding academy&mdash;more
like cowboy ponies. They wore Western
saddles, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all mares,&rdquo; Thorsen explained. &ldquo;Not
too high-spirited and very manageable. Good
mounts for tracking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s eyes were round as he and his horse
confronted each other. &ldquo;This is the closest I&rsquo;ve
ever been to one,&rdquo; he confided to Sandy. &ldquo;I never
realized they were so big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have any trouble,&rdquo; Sandy assured
him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a gentle girl.&rdquo; He stroked the smooth
flanks and the muscles rippled beneath the glossy
black coat. &ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll give you a lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry mounted without difficulty and settled
himself comfortably in the big saddle with his
feet planted in the stirrups. &ldquo;Nothing to it,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Sandy grinned. &ldquo;Nothing to a jet plane either,
while it&rsquo;s sitting in the hangar. Here.&rdquo; He
handed Jerry&rsquo;s rifle up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I do with it?&rdquo; Jerry demanded.</p>
<p>Sandy indicated a large leather sheath that was
fastened to the right side of the saddle. &ldquo;Stick it
in the saddle boot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>They rode out single file, with Thorsen&rsquo;s horse
breaking trail through knee-deep snow across a
broad meadow behind the ranch house. A long
split-rail fence ran along the back of the property.
Thorsen pointed out a break in the fence, where
the heavy logs lay scattered around like jackstraws
and a six-inch post was snapped off at the base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where he came through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the break in the fence a wide path, which
looked as if it had been plowed by a small bulldozer,
led up a slope into a grove of spruce trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be much of a problem tracking him,
will it?&rdquo; Chris Hanson said.</p>
<p>Thorsen shrugged. &ldquo;It depends. We&rsquo;re protected
from the wind in the valley. Farther up in
the mountains, the trail may be covered over by
now. It&rsquo;s been two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Stern swung down off his horse and
knelt to examine the bear&rsquo;s footprints, which had
been almost obliterated by blowing snow. He
brushed away some of the fine, white powder with
his mitten. Abruptly, he looked up at the rancher.
&ldquo;Did any one of your hands take a shot at this
fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorsen frowned. &ldquo;Certainly not. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Stern pointed to faint, rust-colored streaks in
the snow between the imprints of the bear&rsquo;s foot
pads. &ldquo;Looks like blood to me. Probably a
wound, high on the leg, and the blood trickled
down between the toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he hurt himself when he broke
through the fence,&rdquo; Sandy suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; Stern conceded. He walked
back and inspected the broken logs carefully. Finally,
he shook his head. &ldquo;No sign of blood here.
I&rsquo;m afraid our bear has been the victim of a careless
hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorsen scowled fiercely and muttered something
in a guttural foreign tongue. Then he exploded
in English. &ldquo;I would like to get my hands
on that filthy pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Jerry said to Sandy. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
he so excited about? That&rsquo;s the whole idea, isn&rsquo;t
it, to shoot the bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but once you wound an animal, it&rsquo;s your
obligation to finish him off. That&rsquo;s the first commandment
of hunting. First of all, it&rsquo;s cruel to let
an animal suffer. And when you&rsquo;re dealing with
big game, it&rsquo;s downright dangerous. A pain-crazed
bear, for instance, can be a menace to anything
that comes anywhere near him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chris Hanson agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to have to stay on our toes from here on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Professor Stern swung back into the saddle and
they followed the bear&rsquo;s trail into the woods.
There were great, towering ancient pines, clustered
together so that their heavy foliage meshed
to form a solid roof above the forest floor. Only a
fine dusting of snow had filtered through their
heavy branches onto the thick carpet of pine needles
that cushioned the earth. The horses&rsquo; hoofbeats
were barely audible as they picked their way
between the trees, which were bare for at least
twenty feet up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like being in a cathedral,&rdquo; Sandy said reverently.
The voices of the men ahead sounded
embarrassingly loud in the silence beneath the
pines.</p>
<p>A pine cone skittered out from under the hoof
of Jerry&rsquo;s horse and rattled across the dry needles.
Jerry started and almost slipped out of the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch it, boy,&rdquo; Sandy cautioned him. &ldquo;How is
it going, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be okay, once old Dobbin and I get ourselves
co-ordinated. Every time he goes up, I&rsquo;m
coming down and vice versa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too tense. Relax and try
to imagine you&rsquo;re part of the horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what part I feel like,&rdquo; Jerry said wryly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>On the other side of the grove they picked up
the bear&rsquo;s trail again. It headed up a steep, rocky
hillside, dotted with patches of scrubby trees and
huge boulders. The horses had slippery footing
and they went very slowly now.</p>
<p>Thorsen took his rifle out of the saddle boot,
levered a shell into the chamber and rested it
across the saddle in front of him. The other men
followed suit.</p>
<p>Professor Stern turned and smiled reassuringly
at the boys. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed. It just
doesn&rsquo;t pay to take any chances. I&rsquo;ve heard of these
wily old bears doubling back on their trail and
setting up an ambush for unwary hunters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry swallowed hard and cast a nervous glance
back over his shoulder. &ldquo;Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t such a
good idea to bring up the rear.&rdquo; His horse skidded
unexpectedly on a mound of loose stones and
Jerry clutched it frantically around the neck with
both arms, burying his face in the thick mane.
When the horse had steadied itself again, he
straightened up and settled himself gingerly in
the saddle.</p>
<p>He touched one hand to the seat of his pants
and moaned. &ldquo;How can one part of you feel so
hot when the rest of you is so cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was sympathetic. &ldquo;Yeah, I feel for you,
pal. That old saddle gets pretty hard after a while.
And this is a rough way to get initiated to horseback
riding to begin with.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>They rode on for another half hour until they
came to a shallow ravine with a dense growth of
white birch trees and underbrush. Thorsen studied
the steep rocky slopes of the ravine carefully.
Except for a light dusting of snow they were wind-blown
clean, as was the rocky shelf on the other
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any sign of a trail. For all we know,
he may be hiding down there in those trees,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Professor Stern nodded in agreement. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible.
I&rsquo;d hate to run into a Kodiak in those close
quarters. What do we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We play it completely safe,&rdquo; Thorsen replied.
&ldquo;Some of us can ride around the ravine&mdash;it&rsquo;s no
more than a quarter of a mile to the north&mdash;and
see if we can pick up his trail on the other side. If
we do, we can assume he&rsquo;s not waiting to pounce
on us in the ravine. Those who remain here can
safely ride across directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we all ride around together?&rdquo; Chris
wanted to know. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of leaving anyone
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorsen stroked his silky beard. &ldquo;Because if
Mr. Bear <i>is</i> hiding in the ravine, we have him
trapped. One group can flush him out into the
guns of the other group.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;That seems sound,&rdquo; Stern acknowledged.
&ldquo;Which of us will stay here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry and I will,&rdquo; Sandy volunteered. &ldquo;Both
of us are pretty tired, and it&rsquo;ll give us a chance to
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Stern said. &ldquo;Better make sure your
guns are ready for action in case that bear surprises
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the three men rode off along the edge of the
ravine, the boys dismounted and tethered their
horses to a bare, crooked sapling. Sandy sat down
on a boulder with his buffalo gun across his knees,
but Jerry remained standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may never sit down again,&rdquo; he told Sandy.</p>
<p>Soon the three men passed out of sight where
the ravine curved back behind a ridge, and the
boys turned their attention to the birch trees below
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think our bear is down there?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw, I bet he&rsquo;s miles away from here by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were scarcely out of Jerry&rsquo;s mouth
when the sound of a rock clattering down the far
side of the ravine jerked their eyes upward. Standing
beside a big boulder on the rocky shelf facing
them was the biggest bear they had ever seen in
their lives. His long, shaggy fur was tipped with
silver, and on his underside it almost brushed the
ground. The monster seemed oblivious of their presence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he sees us,&rdquo; Sandy whispered to
Jerry. &ldquo;They have very poor eyesight. And we&rsquo;re
upwind of him so he can&rsquo;t smell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the horses caught the scent of the bear and
began to whinny and stamp their hoofs in terror.
The big Kodiak&rsquo;s ears went up and he lifted his
head, probing the air with his sensitive snout.
Slowly he reared up on his hind legs.</p>
<p>Jerry couldn&rsquo;t restrain a gasp of astonishment
and wonder. &ldquo;Wow! Will you look at the size of
him! He must be ten feet tall if he&rsquo;s an inch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the bear stood erect, Sandy could see a
red, matted spot on his left shoulder. &ldquo;Someone
shot him all right,&rdquo; he said. He pressed his lips
firmly together and lifted the big rifle to
his shoulder. &ldquo;Well, here goes.&rdquo; Then he added,
&ldquo;You take a bead on him too, Jerry, in case I
miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so jittery, I don&rsquo;t think I <i>could</i> hit the side
of a barn,&rdquo; Jerry answered breathlessly. Nevertheless,
he brought up his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an easy shot,&rdquo; Sandy told him. &ldquo;Only
about forty yards. I&rsquo;ll try for a head shot. You aim
just below the left shoulder. And take off your
mittens, idiot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Sandy squinted down the long barrel, fixing the
sight on a spot directly between the bear&rsquo;s eyes.
Very gently he squeezed the trigger. There was
a tremendous explosion and a numbing blow
against his shoulder that sent him somersaulting
backward off the boulder. He lay there stunned
for an instant. Then Jerry grabbed the front of
his parka and pulled him to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a recoil,&rdquo; Sandy mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget the recoil!&rdquo; Jerry was hopping up and
down in excitement. &ldquo;You got him! Look! One-shot
Steele, that&rsquo;s you. Bet you could have made
a chump out of Buffalo Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy focused his bleary eyes across the ravine.
The Kodiak was just a big mound of motionless
fur sprawled out on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Jerry pulled at Sandy&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
hurry over there so we can make like big-game
hunters when those other guys show up.&rdquo; Using
his rifle as a staff, he started down the slope into
the ravine.</p>
<p>Sandy caught up to him at the bottom and
grabbed the rifle away from him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever do
anything like that again!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;You
dope! You might have blown your head off&mdash;or at
least your hand. This is a loaded gun. You&rsquo;ve got
to have respect for it. Never point it at yourself or anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Jerry flushed and dropped his eyes. &ldquo;Yeah,
you&rsquo;re right. It was a dopey thing to do. I&rsquo;m so
crazy excited I forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Sandy handed the rifle back to him and
they crashed through the brush and brambles
that grew among the trunks of the birches.
Scrambling up the far slope, Sandy was aware of
a heavy weight banging against his right hip. He
slipped his hand into his pocket on that side and
touched the cold metal grip of the Colt automatic.
He had forgotten about it when he packed the
heavy parka away after the sled race.</p>
<p>He had just withdrawn his hand from his
pocket when Jerry, who was in the lead, reached
the top of the ravine. As his eyes cleared the rim,
he stopped short and let out a wild yell. Then the
bear lumbered into full view, looming over Jerry
like a cat over a very small mouse. The monster&rsquo;s
red-rimmed eyes blazed with hatred and Sandy
could see pink foam gleaming on the long, bared
fangs. It came to him as an incredible shock that
here they were face to face with the most dangerous
living thing in all the world&mdash;a wounded,
pain-crazed Kodiak bear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry! The gun! Shoot!&rdquo; Sandy spat the words
out jerkily.</p>
<p>Obeying mechanically, Jerry swung the long
barrel up and fired in the same motion. The
slug plowed harmlessly between the bear&rsquo;s legs,
kicking up dirt and gravel. But it turned out to be
a lifesaving shot. Caught off balance, Jerry was
kicked off his feet by the booming recoil and went
tumbling head over heels down the steep grade.
At the same time Sandy drew out the big .45 pistol
and cocked it. Then, as the bear dropped to all
fours, with the obvious intention of attacking,
Sandy fired at its hairy throat. The Army Colt
.45-caliber packs a tremendous wallop. At such
close range, it knocked the giant Kodiak back on
its haunches.</p>
<p>Sandy pumped the last bullet into the bear&rsquo;s
midsection, then turned and ran down the slope.
Jerry was just getting to his feet when he reached
the bottom of the ravine. &ldquo;Find a tall tree and
climb it,&rdquo; Sandy yelled. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Together they stumbled into the woods. Sandy
remembered that on their way over they had
passed one gnarled birch with a trunk as big
around as a man&rsquo;s waist. In the manner of so many
trees of this species, it had branched out into
three thick, sturdy limbs at a height of about four
feet. Without breaking his stride, Sandy leaped
up, planted one foot in the crotch and clawed and
shinnied his way up through the branches. He
kept climbing until the limb began to bend beneath
his weight. Then, with his heart fluttering
like a frightened bird, he looked down, half expecting
to see his friend in the embrace of the
great bear. There was no trace of either Jerry or
the Kodiak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; Jerry&rsquo;s voice rang out, so startlingly
close that Sandy almost lost his hold on
the branch. The sight of Jerry swaying back and
forth on an adjacent limb at least five feet above
him, arms and legs wrapped tightly around it like
a monkey, made him weak with relief. In spite
of their precarious position, he had to smile.</p>
<p>Jerry was appalled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s hysterical. Stark, raving
mad,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Sandy! Snap out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that I didn&rsquo;t
expect to see you up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you think I&rsquo;d be? Back there, Indian-wrestling
with old Smokey so you could escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you got up there so fast. I
didn&rsquo;t even see you pass me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; Jerry said huffily, &ldquo;if you had been
as close to that critter as I was you&rsquo;d be back in
Valley View by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As yet there was still no sign of the bear on the
ground below them. Sandy searched the rocky
shelf where they had encountered him, but it was
empty. The clatter of horses&rsquo; hoofs drew his attention
back to the side of the ravine they had
come from. Professor Stern and the other two
men came galloping into view and reined in their
horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, in the tree!&rdquo; Sandy hailed them.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re up in the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stern&rsquo;s face reflected his relief&mdash;and not a little
amazement. &ldquo;What on earth are you doing in a
tree? And what were those shots we heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shot the bear. Then he came to life again
and chased us up here.&rdquo; Sensing the professor&rsquo;s
understandable confusion, he grinned. &ldquo;I guess
that sounds pretty wild, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it does,&rdquo; Stern admitted. &ldquo;But never
mind that. Where is the bear now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Thorsen and Chris Hanson were already starting
down into the ravine, rifles ported for action.
Stem dismounted and followed them. Cautiously
the men made their way through the trees. Before
they reached the far side of the ravine the boys
lost sight of them.</p>
<p>After several minutes of complete silence,
Sandy began to get anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that old bear was hiding behind a
tree,&rdquo; Jerry suggested, &ldquo;and clobbered each one
of them as they went by him, like the Indians
used to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally they heard Stern&rsquo;s voice calling to
them. &ldquo;You guys can come down now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was puzzled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny. I guess the
bear got away after all.&rdquo; He slid hurriedly to the
ground.</p>
<p>When they emerged from the birch grove, both
boys stopped dead. Sandy shut his eyes tight,
opened them, shut them, and opened them again.
He couldn&rsquo;t believe what he saw. The three men
were standing at the bottom of the slope, all flashing
broad grins. At their feet was the mountainous
carcass of the bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you sure he&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo; Sandy stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a tricky one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorsen jabbed his toe into the shaggy body.
&ldquo;Quite dead, I assure you, my young friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had just reached the end of the ravine
when we heard the shots,&rdquo; Professor Stern said.
&ldquo;Now tell us what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Both talking at once, the boys recited the story
of their escapade with the big Kodiak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that old movie <i>King Kong</i>,
where the girl first sees this giant gorilla?&rdquo; Jerry
asked. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s how I felt when this thing
came at me. Oh broth-er!&rdquo; He shuddered.</p>
<p>Sandy took out the black Colt pistol. &ldquo;And this
is what saved our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorsen took it from him and examined it admiringly.
&ldquo;A true gem. Do you know how this gun
was developed? During the Philippine Insurrection,
American troops were being demoralized by
fierce Moro tribesmen, savage warriors who carried
wicked bolo knives. The Moros would pop up
out of the jungle without warning and attack the
soldiers at such close quarters that it was impossible
for them to use their rifles. And the Moros
were so physically powerful that the average pistol
couldn&rsquo;t stop them. Even with a half dozen
bullets in them, they could decapitate an enemy
with their bolos before they died. The Army Colt
.45 was designed especially to stop them. And it
did the job well&mdash;with one slug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly stopped this monster,&rdquo; said Chris
Hanson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it was a very lucky shot,&rdquo; Professor Stern
tempered his praise. &ldquo;The first shot you fired
with the rifle creased his skull and stunned him.
He was probably still whoozy when you ran into
him, or you might not have had a chance to get in
a second shot. Your last shot severed the jugular
vein. It was a very lucky shot,&rdquo; he emphasized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to convince me, Professor,&rdquo;
Sandy said soberly. &ldquo;As of now I am a retired bear
hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</span>
<br />The Ghost Mine</h2>
<p>Two days later the Sterns and the Hansons
came down to the airstrip to see the boys off. Professor
Stern promised to send the bearskin to Valley
View as soon as it was cured. &ldquo;It will make a
nice trophy to spread out in front of your fireplace,&rdquo;
he told Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll donate it to our local boys&rsquo; club,&rdquo;
Sandy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And every time a new fellow joins up, he&rsquo;ll
have an excuse to tell what a big hero he is,&rdquo;
Jerry joked.</p>
<p>Sandy laughed. &ldquo;I bet I looked like a big hero
up in that tree all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Russ Parker appeared in the doorway of the
plane. &ldquo;All revved up and ready to go. You fellows
set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys said their last goodbyes and climbed
into the cabin.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stern waved and yelled, &ldquo;Thanks again for
refilling my freezer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll eat it up the next time we come,&rdquo; Jerry
said.</p>
<p>Parker slammed the door and bolted it, then
went forward to the cockpit. &ldquo;Fasten your safety
belts,&rdquo; he ordered. The little plane took off
smoothly and climbed over the bay. Through the
window next to him, Sandy caught a last glimpse
of the twin domes of the Russian church and the
ancient sea wall with its great iron rings where
the fur traders used to tie up their ships. The sun
sparkled on the blue water and glinted briefly off
the metal oil tanks of the U.S. naval base far
across the bay. Parker leveled off at 10,000 feet
and set a northeast course.</p>
<p>Sandy unbuckled his seat belt and went up front
to the cockpit. &ldquo;How long will it take to fly to
Cordova?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this tail wind no more than two hours,&rdquo;
Parker said. &ldquo;We should be landing a little after
ten. Your dad and the professor want to fly back
to Juneau this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Sandy nodded. &ldquo;From there we&rsquo;re taking a commercial
airline back to Seattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker put the ship on automatic pilot and
turned sideways in the seat. &ldquo;Not driving back
down the highway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Professor Crowell decided the trip was too
rugged in the winter. He&rsquo;s leaving his dogs up
here until spring. Anyway, Jerry and I have to get
back to school, so we were planning to fly back in
any case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listening to the conversation with one ear,
Jerry looked up from the book he was reading.
&ldquo;Hey, Sandy, back in Valley View the guys are
just steeling themselves for a session with Miss
Remson in English Four. Isn&rsquo;t that great? And
here we are three thousand miles away and two
miles in the air. Think we&rsquo;re safe from her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;And Miss Remson would
probably be just as glad if you stayed that far
away from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker pointed out a range of mountains just
visible on the northwest horizon. &ldquo;Too bad you
don&rsquo;t have time to visit the Valley of Ten Thousand
Smokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting name. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before Mount Katmai erupted in 1912 it was
a fertile farm region. Then the whole top of the
mountain blew off&mdash;two cubic miles of rock vaporized
into thin air. One hundred miles away in
Kodiak they had to shovel the dust and ashes off
the roof tops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy whistled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as bad as having an H-bomb
drop in your back yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe worse,&rdquo; Parker said grimly. &ldquo;Then the
entire floor of the valley erupted into little fumaroles,
or volcanic potholes, that spewed out
molten sand. Thousands of them. That&rsquo;s where
they got the name Ten Thousand Smokes. Today
there are only seven of them that are still
active, but the valley is a desert wasteland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy squinted through the windshield, imagining
he could see a thin ribbon of smoke rising
from one of the peaks. &ldquo;What happened to old
Mount Katmai? Is it still active?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the experts think it&rsquo;s still boiling way
down inside. There&rsquo;s a big lake in the crater now,
but it never freezes. I&rsquo;ve heard it&rsquo;s warm enough
to swim in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, who had come forward to listen to the
story, was wonderstruck. &ldquo;Why, I bet you could
land a plane on the lake and find out,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thought,&rdquo; Parker agreed, not too enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Maybe some day I&rsquo;ll try it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>For the remainder of the trip, he captivated the
boys with other tales about the big land, and almost
before they knew it they were approaching
Cordova. The traffic was light and the tower gave
them immediate clearance to land.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour after the plane touched
down, they were on their way to town in the auto
of a radio technician who was going off duty. Russ
Parker remained at the field to give the Norseman
a thorough inspection before the afternoon
flight to Juneau. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take off about one, I
guess,&rdquo; he told them as they were leaving.</p>
<p>The considerate radio man dropped them off in
front of the old-fashioned hotel where Dr. Steele
had said they would be staying. The clerk at the
desk informed them that the geologists were still
registered, but that he had not seen them since
the previous morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you certain they didn&rsquo;t come back when
you were off duty?&rdquo; Sandy asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive,&rdquo; the clerk declared. &ldquo;The chambermaid
said their beds haven&rsquo;t been slept in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy looked at Jerry helplessly. &ldquo;Well, I guess
we&rsquo;ll just have to wait for them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>The clerk gave them a passkey to one of the two
adjoining rooms occupied by Dr. Steele and his
party. When they entered the room, the boys
were surprised to see that the geologists hadn&rsquo;t
even started to pack. Clothing, books and toilet
articles were scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Jerry looked at his wrist watch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re never
going to take off for Juneau at one o&rsquo;clock at this
rate. It&rsquo;s after eleven now. Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t
get the days mixed up, Sandy? Maybe your father
wasn&rsquo;t expecting us until tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little seed of fear began to grow inside of
Sandy. &ldquo;No, he said the third. Professor Crowell
told Russ he wanted to fly to Juneau today, too.
I can&rsquo;t understand it, Jerry. If Dad didn&rsquo;t expect
to be here when we got back from Kodiak, he
would have left word for us. Anyway, they
couldn&rsquo;t have been planning to make any overnight
trips. They didn&rsquo;t take razors, toothbrushes
or anything; my dad shaves every morning even
when he&rsquo;s on a fishing trip miles from civilization.
I don&rsquo;t like it, Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s face turned pale under its perpetual
tan. &ldquo;Sandy, you don&rsquo;t think those enemy agents...?&rdquo;
He left the sentence unfinished.</p>
<p>Before Sandy could reply, the telephone on the
stand between the twin beds jangled harshly. The
boys looked at each other hopefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s Dad calling.&rdquo; Sandy threw himself
across one of the beds and picked up the
receiver eagerly. But it was Russ Parker phoning
from the airfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s anything to worry about,&rdquo;
Parker said, &ldquo;but I just found out that your dad
and his friends chartered a plane yesterday morning
to fly out to McCarthy. That&rsquo;s an old ghost
town near the abandoned Kennecott copper
mine. When they didn&rsquo;t show back last night, the
authorities figured they had been forced down
somewhere with engine trouble. Search planes
have been combing the area all morning, but
there&rsquo;s no sign of the plane, crashed or otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think we should do, Russ?&rdquo;
Sandy asked in a tight voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno. I sort of thought we might fly out
that way ourselves and have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, Russ. Jerry and I will be
out as soon as we can hitch a ride. Thanks for calling.&rdquo;
He slammed down the receiver and related
the latest development to Jerry. Minutes later
they were on their way.</p>
<p class="tb">As they swooped low across the small ghost
town of McCarthy, Parker banked the plane
sharply and indicated the unblemished expanses
of white around the town. &ldquo;No one has set down
here since before the last snow,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anywhere else they might have
landed?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe up at the mine proper. We&rsquo;ll fly up
that way and have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine having a ghost town up here,&rdquo; Jerry
marveled. &ldquo;I thought they were exclusive to the
old American West. It&rsquo;s kind of spooky, everyone
packing up and leaving a place. Almost as if it was
haunted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost towns are haunted in a sense,&rdquo; Sandy
said. &ldquo;By poverty and hunger. They&rsquo;re towns that
build up around mines and have no other livelihood.
If the mines close down they&rsquo;re doomed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any community that puts all its eggs in one
basket runs the risk of becoming a ghost town,&rdquo;
Parker put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did the Kennecott mine shut down?&rdquo;
Sandy asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ore just ran out,&rdquo; Parker said. &ldquo;Here we
are now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Below them Sandy saw a sprawling shedlike
structure that seemed to be hanging on the side of
a hill. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the main building,&rdquo; Parker said.
&ldquo;See those long wires that look like trolley cables?
They used to send the ore down from the shafts
by cable car. Then it was loaded on trains and
shipped to Cordova to be put on ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a level plateau below the Kennecott mine,
they spotted the long twin ski marks of a plane.
There were two sets, one set almost parallel to the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt about it,&rdquo; Parker said. &ldquo;A plane
landed here recently. And it took off again.&rdquo; He
brought the Norseman&rsquo;s nose up and began
climbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they took off again, where <i>did</i> they go?&rdquo;
Sandy was sick with fear. The idea of his father
lying badly injured&mdash;or worse&mdash;in the wreckage
of a crashed plane terrified him. &ldquo;If&mdash;if they had
cracked up, the search planes would have found
them by now, wouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker chewed thoughtfully on his underlip.
&ldquo;I would think so. Unless they wandered outlandishly
far off course. But there isn&rsquo;t any reason
why they should have. The last two days and
nights have been perfect for flying.&rdquo; Ominously,
he added, &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t discount that possibility
altogether. There&rsquo;s so much territory to cover
even with an air search that a small plane might
be missed. In Canada they insist that private
planes follow well-traveled routes like the Alaska
Highway instead of flying the beam, for that very
reason. If you have to make a forced landing,
there&rsquo;s a better chance you&rsquo;ll be found promptly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Sandy implored the pilot, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s land
here and look around. Maybe we&rsquo;ll find a clue or
something to show where they went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker shrugged. &ldquo;Sure, if it&rsquo;ll make you feel
any better. But if they were here, they definitely
took off again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker landed the Norseman smoothly, cutting
across the ski tracks of the other plane. He taxied
to the far end of the clearing, turning her
about in position for a take-off, then cut the engines.
The plane settled heavily in the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks pretty deep out there,&rdquo; Parker estimated.
&ldquo;We better dig out snowshoes from the
baggage compartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had landed about a quarter of a mile away
from the main building of the mine, and because
of the boys&rsquo; inexperience on snowshoes it was a
slow walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel just like a duck,&rdquo; Jerry grumbled as he
brought up the rear, flopping along in the clumsy,
webbed footgear. &ldquo;Overgrown tennis rackets,
that&rsquo;s all they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to try and walk the way
you do in shoes,&rdquo; Sandy instructed him. &ldquo;You just
shuffle along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>At last they stood beneath the big ramshackle
structure. It <i>was</i> spooky, Sandy had to admit to
himself, just as Jerry said. Once this building had
been the nerve center of a booming industry,
buzzing with activity and life. Now it stood on the
hillside, gaunt, decaying and silent. Before many
more years it would become a rickety skeleton.</p>
<p>He shuddered as Parker led them up on the
moldy loading platform and into the tomblike
dampness of the shed. &ldquo;We can go on up to the
main building through here. There are stairs
right inside.&rdquo; They passed through a doorway
into a room illuminated only by the slivers of daylight
that penetrated the cracked boards.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Russ Parker did an about-face and
began talking. &ldquo;Well, here we are.&rdquo; Only he
seemed to be talking to someone in back of them.</p>
<p>Sandy whirled quickly and saw that the doorway
was blocked by a huge man wearing a stocking
cap and a plaid mackinaw. His face was hidden
in shadow. But the big L&uuml;ger pistol in his right
hand was very plain to see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</span>
<br />The Plot Revealed</h2>
<p>In his other hand the stranger carried a square
electric lantern. He turned the powerful beam on
Sandy and Jerry. &ldquo;Did you have any trouble with
them, Parker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; Parker said. &ldquo;The Steele boy suggested
himself that we land here. And of course
there was no trouble at all persuading him to fly
out here with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked from Parker to the other man
in bewilderment. &ldquo;Russ,&rdquo; Sandy pleaded, &ldquo;tell
us what&rsquo;s going on. Who is this guy?&rdquo; He turned
on the stranger belligerently. &ldquo;Do you know
where my father is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Kruger,&rdquo; the man snapped. &ldquo;And,
yes, I do know where your father is. Now, turn
around and march up those stairs.&rdquo; He waved the
pistol at them threateningly.</p>
<p>As the boys started up the stairs, the men fell
behind and lowered their voices. &ldquo;How do you
like that!&rdquo; Jerry declared. &ldquo;Russ Parker is in with
these characters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly believe it,&rdquo; Sandy said miserably.
&ldquo;Anyhow, at least I know Dad is okay&mdash;so far,&rdquo; he
amended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No conversation, please,&rdquo; Kruger ordered
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parker, you sneak,&rdquo; Sandy said bitterly, &ldquo;you
won&rsquo;t get away with this. The authorities know
my dad and his friends are missing. And when we
don&rsquo;t show back at the airfield there&rsquo;ll be even
more search planes combing this area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pilot began to laugh. &ldquo;No one knows your
father and the others are missing. No one at all.
By now the hotel has received a telegram from
Skagway saying that Professor Crowell and his
party returned there on urgent business and that
someone will pick up their luggage and pay their
hotel bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was confused. &ldquo;But&mdash;but what about the
people at the airport? You said there were search
planes out looking for the missing plane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is no missing plane. Yesterday morning
four men rented a plane. Last evening the plane
returned&mdash;with four men. There was another
crew on duty at the airport. They couldn&rsquo;t suspect
that the passengers were four <i>different</i> men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kruger seemed to enjoy the boys&rsquo; discomfort.
&ldquo;By the time the American authorities discover
that any of you are missing you will be well out of
reach in Siberia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Across that narrow stretch of water we were
talking about,&rdquo; Parker taunted them. &ldquo;The Bering
Strait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man with the gun took them through
a series of tunnels that slanted up steeply through
the mountainside. The ascent was severe, and
every ten minutes or so they would stop to
rest. When they emerged into the open again,
Sandy saw that they were at the site of the main
diggings. The terrain was pockmarked with shafts
and tunnels. Rusty train tracks disappeared into
the gloomy mine tunnels, and abandoned dump
cars tilted up through the snow drifts about the
entrances. Far below, the main building of the
Kennecott mine squatted at the foot of the mountain;
from this perspective it reminded Sandy of
a miniature cardboard house sitting on a floor of
cotton beneath a Christmas tree. They followed
a path around a bend to the mouth of a huge tunnel.
To one side of it a flaking, rusted cable car
rocked gently from a metal cable that was equally
rusted. It scraped and screeched monotonously at
the slightest gust of wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;In here,&rdquo; Kruger ordered. &ldquo;This was one of
the main shafts of the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked along the rail ties back about one
hundred yards, where a rectangle of yellow light
splashed into the corridor from a doorway in one
wall of the tunnel. Kruger motioned them
through the doorway into a big chamber that evidently
had served as a locker room for the miners.
Rotting wooden benches and tin lockers cluttered
up the room, many of them overturned, all of
them sagging. A large gasoline lantern burned on
a long wooden table in the middle of the room.
On either side of the table sat a strange man with
a rifle across his knees. Across the table, seated all
in a row on a bench, their hands and feet tied,
were Dr. Steele, Professor Crowell, Lou Mayer
and Tagish Charley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Sandy burst out. &ldquo;Am I glad to see you!
Are you okay?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Dr. Steele managed a strained smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all
right, Son. We all are. But I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m glad to
see you boys.&rdquo; He turned to one of the men with
the rifles. &ldquo;Did you have to drag them into it,
Strak? They&rsquo;re only boys. They don&rsquo;t even know
what this is all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man he addressed, a short, intense fellow
who moved with the quick, nervous motions of a
squirrel, stood up and walked toward the new arrivals.
He stopped in front of Sandy and stroked
his prominent clean-shaven chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is your son, Dr. Steele? A fine-looking
lad.&rdquo; He spoke careful, formal English. &ldquo;I, too,
regret that he and the other youth had to become
involved. But we couldn&rsquo;t take any chances. They
would have notified the police that you were missing
and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool!&rdquo; Professor Crowell snapped.
&ldquo;The police will discover our absence soon
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strak smiled patiently. &ldquo;I disagree. Secrecy has
been the keynote of your project. Only a few
people in both your governments&mdash;high officials&mdash;know
your real purpose in coming to Alaska.
By the time they discover you are missing, we will
all be safely out of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Dr. Steele, you could spare your
son and his friend a lot of unnecessary hardship
by co-operating with us,&rdquo; Kruger said. &ldquo;Just the
answer to one simple question....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasting your time,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said
flatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it your own way.&rdquo; Strak sighed wearily.
&ldquo;You will tell us, you know. That is certain. Today,
tomorrow, next week or six months from
now. We can wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kruger pushed the boys toward the bench
where the other hostages were seated. &ldquo;Parker,
help me tie these two up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boys were securely bound, Strak motioned
Parker to follow him. &ldquo;Come, Parker. Let
us go outside. We have a few things to discuss in
private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want Malik and me to stay here and guard
the prisoners?&rdquo; Kruger asked.</p>
<p>Strak hesitated a moment, then shook his head.
&ldquo;No, come along. You should all hear this.&rdquo; He
glanced at the prisoners. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll get
loose.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;And even if they did, where
would they go? We&rsquo;ll be up at the entrance&mdash;the
only entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four men left the room and their footsteps
echoed off down the tunnel. In the dim light of
the lantern Dr. Steele&rsquo;s face was drawn and pale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself, getting you boys
mixed up in this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Once I knew they
were on to us, that we hadn&rsquo;t deceived them into
thinking this was an innocent geological expedition,
I should have sent you back to California on
the first plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame yourself, Dad,&rdquo; Sandy said quietly.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have left you, knowing that you
were in some kind of serious trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That goes for me too, sir,&rdquo; Jerry backed him
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Sandy said, &ldquo;is how
they caught you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We walked right into their hands,&rdquo; Professor
Crowell explained. &ldquo;Parker knew we were coming
up to the Kennecott mine and tipped them off.
They flew up ahead of us, hid their plane in the
trees and covered up the ski tracks. When we arrived
they were waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole gang of them,&rdquo; Lou Mayer put in.
&ldquo;Seven of them, armed to the teeth. Four of them
took our plane back to Cordova so the people at
the airport wouldn&rsquo;t report us missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Sandy said grimly. &ldquo;They took care
of the hotel too. By the time the authorities get
suspicious it will be too late. The one called Kruger
says we&rsquo;ll be in Russia by then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele and Professor Crowell looked at
each other hopelessly. &ldquo;Unless we tell them what
they want to know,&rdquo; Dr. Steele said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s eyes were puzzled. &ldquo;Just what are they
after? I guess you can tell us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele smiled wanly. &ldquo;I guess we can.&rdquo; He
paused before he went on. &ldquo;Although he&rsquo;s better
known as a geologist, Professor Crowell is one of
Canada&rsquo;s leading physicists. During World War
Two he was assigned to rocket research work for
the Canadian Army and continued to specialize in
this field after the war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About six months ago an old Yukon prospector
submitted an ore sample to a government
assay office at Whitehorse. He said he had
been prospecting on the Alaskan border and
struck what he believed was a vein of gold. An
analysis of the sample revealed traces of copper,
but no gold. But much more important, it revealed
strains of a rare element that the Canadian
government was testing as a catalytic agent in top-secret
experiments with a new solid rocket fuel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For years now rocket experts have acknowledged
that solid fuels are more practical than liquid
propellants&mdash;even more so for the big manned
rocket ships of the future. The trouble is, up until
now the solid fuels haven&rsquo;t been too dependable.
Professor Crowell believes this new element
will solve the most serious drawbacks, but unhappily
it&rsquo;s about as rare as uranium. During the
past few months there have been teams out searching
for it all over the Dominion, without much
success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, unexpectedly, this old prospector
shows up with an ore sample laced liberally with
it. The assay office at Whitehorse dispatched it to
Ottawa immediately and Professor Crowell was
consulted. It was his opinion that they were on to
something big. A special agent flew up to Whitehorse
to interview the prospector, but tragically&mdash;any
way you look at it&mdash;the poor old man had
passed away from pneumonia only a few days before
the agent arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the big problem was to find out where
the dead man had picked up the ore. All kinds of
soil and rock analyses were made on it without
any specific results. It was the professor&rsquo;s guess
that it came from somewhere in the vicinity of the
Kennecott copper mine. There was copper in
the sample, of course, and the old miner had
mentioned vaguely at the assay office that he had
discovered it somewhere &lsquo;on the border.&rsquo; A layman
couldn&rsquo;t be expected to know exactly where
the border lies; actually, he may have wandered
well into Alaska.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;In any case, the Canadian government conferred
with Washington, and it was decided to send
a joint team up to Alaska composed of Professor
Crowell, Lou Mayer and myself.&rdquo; He glanced toward
the doorway and added sourly, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
count on it ending up a three-nation team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they find out?&rdquo; Sandy wanted to
know.</p>
<p>Dr. Steele shrugged. &ldquo;They have the most efficient
espionage system in the world. That we
have to give them credit for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy pursed his lips solemnly. &ldquo;But they still
don&rsquo;t know what the element is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or how it&rsquo;s employed in the manufacture of
the rocket fuel,&rdquo; Professor Crowell declared emphatically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only one who can tell them
that. And I&rsquo;ll die first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch it,&rdquo; Jerry cautioned. &ldquo;I think I hear
them coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of approaching footsteps reverberated
hollowly through the mine. Strak appeared
in the doorway alone. &ldquo;Kruger and Malik have
gone down the mountain to help Parker clear a
runway,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be taking off with
a heavy load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy made a quick mental count. &ldquo;That plane
will never get off the ground with ten of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strak smiled. &ldquo;I agree. But there are only seven
of us who will be making the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Dr. Steele demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that you and your son and Professor
Crowell are the only ones who have any real value
to us. The rest will remain here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele was shocked. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t intend to
leave them tied up in this mine? They&rsquo;ll starve to
death or die of exposure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strak shrugged. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a risk we will have to
take. Perhaps in time they may be able to get
loose. Perhaps they will make it back to civilization.
Who can tell? The Indian seems to be a resourceful
woodsman.&rdquo; He walked over and stood
in front of Tagish Charley. &ldquo;Tell me, Doctor, he
<i>is</i> alive, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tagish Charley&rsquo;s face betrayed no trace of emotion.
He had not spoken a word since the boys&rsquo;
arrival. All the while he had sat stiffly on the
bench, hands behind him, eyes staring fixedly at
the rock wall in front of him&mdash;as detached as any
cigar-store Indian could be, or so it seemed to
Sandy.</p>
<p>In sudden irritation Strak bent close to Charley,
flashing his electric torch into his face. &ldquo;You
insolent Indian dog! You can speak, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Then, for the first time, Charley showed some
sign of life. Slowly he lifted his eyes to Strak&rsquo;s
face and said solemnly, &ldquo;Charley too busy to talk&mdash;until
<i>now</i>!&rdquo; As he shouted the last word, his
two powerful arms whipped free from behind him
and wrapped around his tormentor.</p>
<p>Strak tried desperately to bring up his rifle,
but he was helpless in Charley&rsquo;s grizzly-bear hug.
The air whistled out of his lungs like a wheezing
bellows, and there was the distinct snap of a rib
cracking. He moaned softly and fainted. Charley
let him drop to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atta boy, Charley!&rdquo; Jerry said exultantly.</p>
<p>They all winced as the Indian held up his
hands in the light. His wrists were raw and bleeding
from rubbing at the rope. &ldquo;Big spike in bench
where I sit. Slow work, but at end I saw rope
through.&rdquo; He bent over Strak and removed a
hunting knife from the man&rsquo;s belt. Quickly he cut
through the ropes that bound his own ankles.
Then he went along the bench freeing the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Dr. Steele said, grabbing up
Strak&rsquo;s rifle from the ground. &ldquo;No time to lose.
The others will be coming back soon.&rdquo; He led
the way out of the room and down the tunnel to
the entrance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>At the foot of the mountain beyond the abandoned
mine building, they could see the plane sitting
like a toy in the snow. The three enemy
agents were bustling around it, mere specks at
this distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re still working on the runway,&rdquo; Sandy
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do when they come back?&rdquo; Jerry
asked.</p>
<p>Lou Mayer indicated the rifle the doctor was
holding. &ldquo;We have one gun. We can make a fight
of it at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele was not enthusiastic. &ldquo;All three of
them are armed. I&rsquo;m afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t be much
of a fight.&rdquo; His voice was grim. &ldquo;Some of us would
be hurt&mdash;or killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t we rush down the hill when we
see them start up?&rdquo; Professor Crowell suggested.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be inside, coming up through the shafts.
By the time they got up here, we&rsquo;d have quite a
head start on them. If we get to that plane&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele shook his head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d never stand a
chance without snowshoes, and they&rsquo;re all down
at the mine shed. They&rsquo;d have a field day picking
us off with their rifles while we flounder through
those hip-deep drifts on the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve got no choice,&rdquo; Lou Mayer said
gloomily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to make a stand here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; Sandy cried out, the bud of
a wild inspiration forming in his mind. &ldquo;Is there
any chance <i>that</i> thing still works?&rdquo; The others followed
his gaze upward to the old cable car creaking
and rocking to the right of the entrance.</p>
<p>The professor sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. These
cable cars were operated by power machinery
down at the depot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;d be coasting
downhill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a gleam of interest in Dr. Steele&rsquo;s
eyes. &ldquo;That sounds logical. What do you say we
have a look at it, Son? But keep down. We don&rsquo;t
want Kruger and the others to spot us against the
snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They slunk out of the shadow of the mine entrance,
darting quickly behind the cover of the
cable car. Dr. Steele climbed into the open cab
and squinted up at the rigging. &ldquo;Looks to me as if
the only thing that&rsquo;s restraining it is that safety
lock,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Sandy disagreed. &ldquo;What about the pulley cable?
That must be anchored in the shed below. She
won&rsquo;t roll unless that&rsquo;s free.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Dr. Steele studied the arrangement of rollers
and cables more closely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he admitted.
He pointed to the steel hook-eye at the
back of the car where the pulley cable was attached.
&ldquo;The wire is pretty frayed back here. Possibly
we could hack through it. I saw an old ax
back in the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure worth a try,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;How do
you think that overhead cable will hold up when
we start rolling downhill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s in pretty good condition. They put
a good coating of grease on all the machinery before
they shut the mine down. They must have
hoped to use it again, or possibly to sell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Crowell&rsquo;s voice rang out urgently
from the tunnel entrance. &ldquo;Hurry up! Kruger
and the others are starting back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele pulled Sandy down out of sight in
the car. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay here until they enter the
shed.&rdquo; He called over to Tagish Charley, &ldquo;Charley,
duck back into the mine and get a couple of
those picks that are lying around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peering over the rim of the cable car, Sandy
watched the three men make their way on snowshoes
back to the mine. As soon as they had disappeared
into the shed, Dr. Steele shouted for the
others. &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ve got to work fast. Charley,
over here with those picks, quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Lou Mayer, Professor Crowell and Jerry scrambled
aboard the car while Dr. Steele gave instructions
to Tagish Charley. &ldquo;You work on the hook-eye
and pulley, Charley. I&rsquo;ll knock out the safety
lock. The rest of you just pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One solid blow tripped the safety lock, and the
car moved forward about a foot until the taut cable
stopped it. The cable itself was more of a
problem. Sandy had the uncomfortable sensation
that his leaping heart was trying to squirm out of
his throat and escape from his body.</p>
<p>The tension was unbearable as Charley
pounded away at the pulley with strong rhythmic
strokes of the ax. At first it seemed impervious to
the dull blade. Then, with relief, Sandy saw one
strand snap with a musical twang. Charley swung
harder, encouraged by this success, and another
strand broke. Each strand that let go put additional
stress on the remaining strands, making
Charley&rsquo;s task a little easier. The last two snapped
together with a loud report.</p>
<p>The car shuddered and began to roll forward
slowly. There was the nerve-shattering screech of
metal against metal as the overhead rollers and
the main cable protested violently at being used
so rudely after twenty-one years of inactivity.
Snow, rust and metal shavings cascaded down on
the car&rsquo;s occupants as it picked up momentum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>The boys let go with a tremendous cheer and
Professor Crowell and Dr. Steele shook hands solemnly.
Sandy glanced behind them at the rapidly
diminishing tunnel entrance, but as yet there was
no sign of Kruger and the other two enemy
agents.</p>
<p>Fortunately the pitting of the cable and the
rust and stiffness of the rollers reduced their acceleration
sufficiently so that they crashed into
the bumpers at the foot of the incline with only a
moderate jolt. The cable car split the rotting
wood on the bumper&rsquo;s face, but the springs behind
it cushioned the jolt.</p>
<p>Sandy extricated himself from the mass of
scrambled limbs gingerly. &ldquo;Everybody okay? No
broken bones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a chorus of relieved okays.</p>
<p>Dr. Steele climbed out into the snow. &ldquo;All
right. Into the shed and on with those snowshoes.&rdquo;
Apprehensively, he looked up the mountain,
but the enemy agents still had not appeared.</p>
<p>As Sandy strapped on the great clumsy snowshoes,
he made a suggestion. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take the other
four pairs with us. That will slow them up even
more if they try to follow us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Tagish Charley grunted. &ldquo;But I
got better one.&rdquo; He picked up the ax he had carried
with him from the cable car and began to
attack the surplus snowshoes furiously. When he
had demolished them, he straightened up and, to
everyone&rsquo;s amazement, grinned broadly. &ldquo;They
no go very far now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were halfway to the plane when a distant
gunshot came to them faintly through the thin,
dry air. Turning, Sandy could make out three ant-like
specks on the mountainside near the tunnel
where they had been held prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve discovered we&rsquo;re gone,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re shooting at us,&rdquo; Jerry commented
nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not in much danger at this range,&rdquo; Professor
Crowell assured them. &ldquo;Without telescopic
sights, it would take a mighty lucky shot to hit
anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they were all greatly relieved
when they were seated snugly in the cabin of the
plane and Professor Crowell had the motors gunning
smoothly. &ldquo;Those fellows did a mighty fine
job on this runway,&rdquo; the professor said charitably.
He advanced the throttle and the ship glided
ahead smoothly. They cleared the trees at the far
end of the clearing with plenty of room to spare
and climbed in a sweeping curve that took them
over the mountain. Far below on the snowy slope
they could see the frustrated agents hopping
about and shaking their fists in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</span>
<br />Final Victory</h2>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve caught the entire gang!&rdquo; Dr. Steele
reported excitedly as he burst into the boys&rsquo; hotel
room at Cordova a little after eight the next
morning.</p>
<p>Sandy sat up and massaged the sleep from his
eyes. &ldquo;No kidding, Dad. When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Army Intelligence moved in on Strak, Parker
and the other two at dawn. They gave up without
a fight. Seems they put in a pretty rough night.
Strak was in bad shape, thanks to Charley, but
he&rsquo;ll live to stand trial for espionage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the rest of the gang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The local police arrested them as they were
trying to board a freighter at Valdez. It&rsquo;s a clean
sweep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; Jerry was awake now, his eyes as big
and shiny as tin plates. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call action.&rdquo;
Grinning, he added, &ldquo;We sure could have used a
little bit of that kind of action yesterday. Where
were all the cops and G-men then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an operation like this one,&rdquo; Dr. Steele explained,
&ldquo;they had to stay way out on the fringes
until the last moment. That was a risk we knew
we&rsquo;d have to take from the start if we hoped to
spring a trap on this gang of ruthless saboteurs. If
we had an army of bodyguards dogging our footsteps,
they never would have been lured in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lured in?&rdquo; Sandy was perplexed. &ldquo;You mean
we were sort of decoys for the spies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way,&rdquo; Dr. Steele admitted. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell
you that, even yesterday. But now it&rsquo;s officially
okay to let you in on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the rocket fuel Professor
Crowell was working on? I thought we came up to
look for some rare element.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That of course was our primary reason for
coming to Alaska. And of course we&rsquo;ll continue to
search for Element X. But when the enemy agents
began to hound us so persistently, we saw an opportunity
to make a double killing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry stretched. &ldquo;Only we came awful close to
being the ones who were killed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;We had a narrow scrape,&rdquo; Dr. Steele agreed.
&ldquo;It was ingenious of them to take back the plane
to Cordova after they ambushed us at the mine.
Our people were holding back, of course, and it
really threw them off the trail. As far as they
knew, we had checked back into the city and then
disappeared into thin air. With a bit more luck
the gang might have smuggled us out of the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry laughed. &ldquo;Hey, Sandy, can you see us
going to school in Siberia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, no,&rdquo; Sandy told him. &ldquo;You have
enough trouble with English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele broke in with &ldquo;That reminds me.
We have to think of getting you boys back to Valley
View. You don&rsquo;t want to miss too much more
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself, Doctor,&rdquo; Jerry crowed.
&ldquo;How can you expect us to go back and associate
with little school kids after battling Yukon blizzards,
Kodiak bears and spies? It&rsquo;s positively undignified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Steele smiled tolerantly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel that
way, Jerry. Remember, adventure and excitement
may be just around the corner, whether
you&rsquo;re in Alaska or California.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Jerry said thoughtfully.
Then he added, with a gleam in his eye, &ldquo;Besides,
it&rsquo;ll be great to come up with our story when
Pepper March starts spouting about that cruise
he was supposed to take. Boy, will <i>his</i> eyes pop!
And you know what? We might even be able to
stump Quiz Taylor. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be something?
Okay, Valley View, here we come! How about it,
Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy stretched blissfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready. In fact,
I&rsquo;m way ahead of you. How about next summer?&rdquo;</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
